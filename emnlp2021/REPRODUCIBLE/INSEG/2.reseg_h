last year , i &apos;ve been using these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ice cap , which is about three million years old , is the size of the lower 48 states , by 40 percent shrunk . 
but this does not express strong enough the seriousness of this particular problem , because it is not the thickness of the ice . in a sense , 
the arctic ice cap is the beating heart of our global climate system . 
it grows in winter and shrinks in summer . 
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a time lapse , which is what happened in the last 25 years . 
the duration is red marked . 
how you see it grows on the dark blue , this is the annual ice in the winter , and it shrinks in the summer . 
so @-@ called &quot; dauereis &quot; , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which flows out of the body here . 
in 25 years , it will be from here to here that it will have disappeared . 
this is a problem because warming is the frozen reason to get the arctic ocean up . in this , it &apos;s causing large amounts of frozen carbon , which , if it &apos;s depleted , is coming from microbes to methane . 
compared to the total amount of climate @-@ changing substances in the atmosphere , this amount could double if we were to take this critical point . 
even today , in some shallow lakes in alaska , methane is bubbling by itself from the water . 
professor katey walter of the university of alaska is associated with another working group on another one , flat lake , last winter . 
video : wow al gore , you &apos;re doing well , the question is , how will we be ? 
and one reason is this enormous heat storage system is warming greenland from the north . 
this is an annual dew water flow . 
but the volumes are much larger than ever before . 
this is the kangerlussuaq river in southwest greenland . 
if you want to know how sea level is rising through land ice melting , here it flows into the sea . 
these rivers are growing rapidly . 
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest ice mass on the planet . 
last month , researchers reported that the entire continent is now facing a negative ice balance . 
and the west antarctica , which has a few underwater islands , is particularly strong in melting . 
this corresponds to 20 feet above sea level , just like greenland . 
in the himalayas , the third largest ice mass , you can see new lakes that were glaciers a few years ago . 
40 percent of all people in the world get half of their drinking water from this melting water . 
in the andes , this glacier is the drinking water source for this city . 
the amounts of water have increased . 
but if they seal , the same thing is that most drinking water will fall away . 
in california , a 40 % reduction in snow cover in sierra has been seen . 
this concerns the storage tanks . 
and the predictions of how they read them are serious . 
this drying up throughout the world leads to a dramatic increase in the amount of fires . 
and the disasters everywhere on earth , have been in a really extraordinary and previously never @-@ before unprecedented scale . 
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 . 
this is a totally unacceptable pattern of development . 
if you do this in the historical context , you can see what it &apos;s doing . 
in the last 5 years , we &apos;ve been able to produce 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours , 25 million tons every day , into the oceans . 
look at the area of the eastern pacific , exactly from the american continent to the west and on both sides of the indian subcontinent , where there is a drastic decline in oxygen in the oceans . 
the largest single factor for global growth is that , in addition to deforestation , which is 20 percent , fossil fuel burning . 
oil is a problem and coal is the same thing , but it &apos;s the biggest problem . 
the united states is one of the two largest polluters , along with china . 
and the proposal was to create many more coal factories . 
but we &apos;re starting to see a change . 
here are the ones that have been in the last few years , with some green alternatives that have been proposed . 
but there is a political struggle in our country . 
and the coal industries and oil industries have a quarter of a billion dollars last year spent on applying clean coal , which in itself is a contradiction in itself . 
this picture reminded me of something . 
at christmas , the people were running at home in tennessee , where i had one billion tons of coal sludge . 
you have probably seen it in the news . 
this is in our country , the second largest waste flow in america . 
this happened around christmas . 
one of the commercials of the coal industry around christmas was this . 
frosty the carbarian is a happy , happy guy . 
he &apos;s in the shell and fullness , in america , and he helps our economy to grow . 
frosty the carboniferous will be cleaner every day . 
he &apos;s affordable and kind , and workers stay in wages and bread . 
al gore : this is the source of most coal in west virginia . 
the most powerful miner is the head of massey coal . 
video : don blankenship - let me just make one thing clear : al gore , nancy pelosi , harry reid - you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about . 
al gore : so the alliance for climate protection has launched two campaigns that are going on . 
this is a part of her . 
video actor at the coalergy , we see climate change as a serious threat to our business . 
that is why we have made it the top line : a considerable amount of money to spend on advertising , and we have to get it going to tell the truth about coal . 
the fact is that coal is not dirty . 
we believe it &apos;s clean and smells of it , too . 
so they &apos;re not worried about the fact that climate change is happening . 
leave the quiet to us . 
video actor saueber kohle : &quot; you have heard a lot of that . 
so let &apos;s have a tour of this modern , clean coal factory . 
fantastic , this machine is pretty noisy . 
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology . 
and yet , burning coal , a burning of coal , is one of the main reasons for global warming , and the remarkably clean coal technology that you see here , changes everything . 
look at it exactly . this is the most recent clean , coal technology . 
al gore : finally , the positive alternative is mixed with our economic challenge and challenge . the national security challenge . 
video narrator : america is in crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis . 
the red thread that all connects these is our dependence on the carbon @-@ based fuels , like dirty coal and foreign oil . 
but now there &apos;s a brave new solution to help us out of this miserable situation . 
supply america with 100 percent clean electricity . new within the next 10 years . 
a plan to america back to work - to make us safer and safer and to help us to reduce global warming - 
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems . 
supply america , find more out more . 
al gore : this is the last . 
video narrator : it &apos;s about resupply of america . 
one of the fastest ways to reduce our dependence on old dirty fuels that suffocate our world is to reduce it . 
man : the future is here : wind , sun and a new energy system . 
man no. 2 : new investments to make well @-@ paid jobs 
narrator : supply america new . it &apos;s time to accept reality . 
al gore : there &apos;s an old african proverb : &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone . &quot; 
if you come far , go together . 
we need to get far , fast . 
thank you . on the 
last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc . 
and i promised to come back to tell them , how to get the machine working . 
now it &apos;s time and for the rest of those who were not there at the time , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever done . &quot; &#91; 27 kilometers &#93; in diameter . 
his task is to improve the conditions . they are less than one billionth of a second after the beginning of the universe , and they can do up to 600 million times within a second . 
it &apos;s just breathtaking , ambitious . 
this is the machine below geneva . 
we take pictures of these mini big bang in detectors . 
this is where i work , he &apos;s called atlas detector , 44 meters wide , 22 meters wide , in diameter . here &apos;s a 
spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction so you can see the size . 
on september 10 last year , the machine ran for the first time . 
and this picture was taken by atlas . 
it caused immense cheering in the control room . 
it &apos;s a picture of the first particle of radiation that &apos;s going to make the entire route around the lhc , then deliberately moving into a part of the lhc to get a rain from particles to the detector . 
in other words , when we saw this picture on september 10 , we knew that the machine was working , which was a great triumph . 
i don &apos;t know if this is the greatest cheering , or if it &apos;s someone who created google &apos;s site , and the home page found that way . 
it means that we have a cultural influence next to the scientific achievements . 
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine , which was connected to these wires here . this problem was this golden wires here . 
these wires lead 13 thousand amps when the machine is running at high performance . 
now the engineers , among them , you &apos;re going to look at them and say , &quot; no , you &apos;re not doing that . &quot; these are small wires . you 
can do that because if you do it very far , you &apos;re going to cool it down to 
so @-@ called superconductors . at minus 271 degrees , that is colder than the space between the stars , these wires can change the tension . 
in one of the connections between over nine thousand magnets in the lhc , there was a manual defect . 
heat up the wires slightly and then 13 thousand amps suddenly met electric resistance . 
this was the result . 
well , all this is even more impressive when you imagine that the magnets are about 20 tons weigh and the magnets are about 30 cm wide , and they &apos;re moving . 
we damaged about 50 % of the magnets . 
and they had to remove what we did . 
we conditioned them , repairing them . 
you are all back on your own path . 
towards the end of march , the lhc will be operational again . 
we will turn it on and expect first data in june or july to collect , to be able to set our journey on to find out what the building blocks of the universe are . 
now , of course , in a way , such accidents are once again igniting the debate about the value of science and engineering at such borders . it &apos;s easy to reject this . 
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to understand the fact that we &apos;re talking about our borders is that we &apos;re going to make the value of things like the lhc . 
i &apos;m going to give my final words to an english scientist , humphrey davy , who , as i suspect , when he was defending his apprentice as a futile experiment , was michael faraday , who said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind to assume that our scientific ideas are definitive , that there are no mysteries in nature , that our triumphs are full of numbers , and that there are no new worlds to conquer 
thank you . 
i would like to start by asking you to go back to the time you were childhood , when you played with blocks of blocks . 
while they realized how to get hands stretched out and grab the blocks , and move them , they actually learned to think about and solve problems by understanding and changing things in spatial relationships . the 
spatial thinking is close to it , how we can make up a lot of our environment . 
as an informatics specialist inspired by the way we interact with real objects , along with my specialist adviser patti and my colleague jeevan kalanithi , i started to wonder what i would be like if we were to use computers that were to be used instead of a mouse pointer that was like a digital finger tip on a flat worksurface , what if we were to intervene with both hands and physically grab data ? 
and they sort of could arrange as we want . 
this question was so gripping that we were able to go into the answer and to make siftables . 
in short , a siftable is an interactive computer in size , a biscuit . 
you can use your hand to move you . you can move each other , you can perceive your movements , and you have a screen and a radio receiver . 
much more important are physical , which is why they are just made by stretching out the hands and accessing , moving , like building blocks . 
and the siftables are an example of a new generation of tools to manipulate digital data . 
and if these aids become more physical and a consciousness for their movements develops , mutually , recognize each other , and the subtleties of our handling with them , then we can work with the exploration of new and entertaining interaction types . 
i &apos;m starting with some simple examples . 
this siftable is suitable for video playback and if i want to use it in one direction , the video will move forward when i want to play it in the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards . 
and these interactive portraits take each other . 
if i want to put them next to each other , then you &apos;re arousing interest . 
if you are surrounded by one @-@ wire , you will notice that , and you can become nervous . 
and they feel their movements and their inclination . 
an interesting episode of the interactions that we can see was the fact that we &apos;ve seen everyday gestures on data that we could use , like colors , to pour as much as we do with liquids . 
in this case , we have three siftables as color pots configured , and i can use them to color in the color in the middle of the water where they then mixed . 
if we exaggerate it , we can do a little bit of a bit of backsliding . 
there are also some nice ways to get to know education , such as languages , mathematics , or logic games , where we can give people the chance to try out quickly and see the results immediately . 
here i am , that &apos;s a fibonacci episode that i &apos;ve been able to create with a simple equation program . 
that &apos;s a game with words that have a kind of mixture of scrabble and boggle , and that &apos;s a game with words . 
basically , you get every round , every siftable randomly assigned letter and during you try to get words to form , these letters are written through a dictionary . 
then after about 30 seconds , the mixture is mixed again , and you have a new combination of letters and new ways to try out . 
thank you . 
these are some children who are on a trip to the media lab . i could not help them to try it out , and i had a video of it . 
you have really loved it . 
an interesting fact in this type of application is that you can see people not having a lot of instructions . 
all you say is that you make words and you know that exactly what you need to do . 
here are another few people who have been testing it . 
that &apos;s our youngest beta tester down there on the right . 
it turned out that he was the siftables , stacking only . 
so for him , they were just building blocks . 
this is an interactive animation . 
we wanted to use a language learning tool . 
that &apos;s felix . 
he can create new characters into the scene by playing the game siftable from the table . he &apos;s going to show this figure . 
here he leaves the sun rising . 
now he &apos;s picking up a tractor in the scene . 
good work , yes . 
by making the siftables shaken and she is lying side by side , he can let the characters interact . his own story 
inventing . it &apos;s a 
story with an open end , and it can decide how to develop . 
the last example of what i &apos;m going to have time to show is a music sequencer for live performances that we &apos;ve recently developed , and that &apos;s where siftables is called sounds like leadership voice , bass , and drums . 
everyone has four different variations . you can choose which one you want to use . 
and you can hear these sounds in the sequence that you can put into any pattern , and you can sort them in any pattern . 
and you feed them in by eating them , just by adding a sound @-@ siftable to a sequence @-@ siftable . 
there are effects that you can change live , like the effects of hall and filter . 
you connect it to a certain tone and tend to make it a bit more adjustable . 
and then , more generally , effects like tempo and volume that you can see on the entire sequence . 
so let &apos;s look . 
we start in which we have the lead in two sequence siftable feed @-@ in and they &apos;re ordering in a number of ways , they &apos;re expanding and adding a little bit more of the voice . 
now i add a bass . 
now i &apos;m going to do some more stuff about it . 
and now i connect the filter to the drums so that i can see the effect live , 
and i can control it . i can &apos;t see the whole sequence quicker by accelerating the pace into which one or the other direction 
is tilting . and now i connect the filter to the filter with the bass for a little more expression . 
i can &apos;t see the sequence as it runs . 
this means that i do not have to plan them in advance , but can improvise , prolong or shorten them while doing so . 
and finally , i can see the whole sequence by hiding the volume @-@ siftable to the left . 
thank you . 
how do you see , then , is my enthusiasm for creating new human computer interfaces that are better suited to fit , like our brains and bodies . 
and today i had time to give you part of this new design world , and some of the ways that i could show you what we &apos;re working on in our lab . 
the idea i &apos;m going to share with you is that we have a lot of work on the threshold of this new generation of witnesses . we &apos;re going to interact with digital media that can provide information into our world , which meets our requirements . 
thank you . i am 
looking forward to the talks with you all . 
i am a writer . 
books to write is my profession , but it &apos;s more natural than writing that . 
it is also my great lifelong love and fascination . 
and i don &apos;t expect the world to change . 
however , recent , something strange in my life and career is happening , which has made me feel like i &apos;ve been referring to this work completely rethinking . 
this strange event was that i recently had a book written , a biography called eat , pray , love , which decided to be different from all my previous books from any reason in the world for some reason , and a great mega event became an international bestseller thing . 
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to be treated as if i was doomed . 
seriously , dedicated to 
the demise . for example , they are very concerned about me and say , &quot; fear not that you &apos;re going to never succeed in surpassing that . 
&quot; have you no fear that you can make your whole life continue and never again have a book created that someone can write in the world that &apos;s interested in ? never again . okay 
, that really makes you brave . 
it would be worse , however , if i did not remember that i was going to be in the middle of the world more than 20 years ago , when i first told me , as a teenager , that i wanted to be a writer , i was confronted with the same kind of fear @-@ filled reaction . 
people said , &quot; have you not been afraid , never succeed ? &quot; have you not been 
afraid that the humiliation of a rejection will kill you ? 
have you not been afraid that you can do this craft all your life and never get anything out of it , and that you can do it on a scrap pile of burst dreams ? your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failure . so 
, you know , you know . 
the answer : the short answer to all these questions is yes . 
yes , i &apos;m afraid of all these things . 
and he i always had . 
and i &apos;ve been thinking a lot more about things that nobody could imagine how algae would be and other terrifying things . 
but if it comes to writing , i think recently about it , and i wonder , why ? 
is that reasonable ? 
is it logical that someone expects that they should be expected to be afraid of getting rid of the work ? to which he is called to do so ? 
and what exactly is the creative work of the company that they &apos;re going to get us unsure about the state of mind in a way that other professions don &apos;t do ? 
my father , for example , was a chemist , and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist , in which he was asked if he was afraid of becoming a chemist . with your chemist blockade 
john , how are you doing it ? 
it just didn &apos;t happen . you know . 
but to be fair , the group of chemists have been talking about the centuries , not the reputation of alcoholic , manic @-@ depressive people . 
we writers seem to have this kind of reputation . but we don &apos;t just have writers , but creative writers , of all genres , seem to have this reputation , mentally unstable , unstable . 
all you do is to get yourself the bitter death figures of really great heads . just out of the 20th century alone , young and young , and often by their own hands , died . 
and even those who don &apos;t actually begin suicide seemed to have been really neglected by their talents . norman mailer said 
, &quot; just before his death , in his last interview , each of my books has taken me a little further . 
an extraordinary statement that you have about your life &apos;s work . 
but we &apos;re not even twitching when we &apos;re not even saying something like this because we &apos;re hearing this kind of statement for so long , somehow we &apos;ve been in the view of how we internalized and collectively accepted creativity and suffering somehow , of course , belong together , and that art is always in the end torment . 
the question i have asked everyone here today is this : is this idea for you ? 
is it perfectly okay ? 
feel free to do so . because with only one centimeter distance , i feel like i &apos;m feeling like this view is not at all comfortable . 
i think it &apos;s horrible . 
and i think they &apos;re dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to watch them go into the next century . 
i think it &apos;s better if we can make our big creative encouragement to live . 
and i definitely know that it &apos;s a very good thing for me in my situation to start to follow this dark path of presumption , so to speak , leakage , especially in the fact that i &apos;m just in my career . 
that means you see , i &apos;m pretty young , i &apos;m just about 40 years old . 
i may have more than 40 years of work in me . 
and it &apos;s very likely that everything that i &apos;ve got from now on will be written by the world as the work that &apos;s being evaluated after the departure success of my last book came right , right ? 
i say it straight out , because we are here all of us friends , somehow , right now . it &apos;s most likely that my greatest success is behind me . 
oh jesus , what a thought ! 
these are the kind of thoughts that someone has to get to know at 9 a.m. gin gin gin . and they &apos;re the kind of thoughts that i don &apos;t want to do . 
i would rather continue to do this work that i love . 
so the question is , how ? 
after some time of reflection , i think i &apos;m going to continue writing to be able to write a kind of protective psychological construct . somehow i 
have to get a picture of a way to write , to find a safe distance between me and me , and my very natural anxiety about how the reaction to the written being will be . 
while i was in the process of looking for models for this last year to do that , i also had a lot of time to look for in the past , and i tried to find other societies to see if they could be better or more sensible than we did , how to help creative people to get involved with emotional risks that might be associated with creativity . 
this search led me into ancient greece and the old rome . 
please follow me , because the circle will change again . 
but in ancient greece and rome , the people don &apos;t believe that creativity is the creativity of people . okay . they 
believed that creativity was a kind of divine servant spirit that came from a distant , unknown source to people , from inexplicable , unknown reasons . 
the greeks called these divine servants @-@ spirits of creativity demons . by 
socrates , it is known that he believed that he had a demon who gave him wisdom from afar . 
the romans had the same idea , they called this kind of bodyless , creative spirit , a genius . 
that &apos;s great . &quot; the romans didn &apos;t really think a genius was a particularly smart individual . 
they believed that a genius could not do this kind of magical divine being that was believed to be proverbial in the world walls of an artist &apos;s studio , about the same way dobby , the housemate , would come out of the room and make the artist , in a sense , invisible in work , and would shape the result of the work . 
that &apos;s brilliant , it &apos;s there , it &apos;s the distance from which i was talking , the psychological construct that was going to tell you about the consequences of your work . 
and everyone knew that it worked like this , right ? 
the artist of antiquity was in front of certain things protected , such as too much narcissism , right ? 
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at everything for yourself , everyone knew that you could do this body @-@ less genius that helped you . 
if your work didn &apos;t flop completely , your mistake , right ? 
everyone knew your genius was a bit lame . 
so the people in the west really have a long time talking about creativity . 
and then the renaissance came , and everything changed . we had these great ideas , and these great ideas were the idea , &quot; let &apos;s let the human individual go to the center of the universe , to all the gods and mysteries , and there &apos;s no room for mystical creatures anymore , to accept the commands of the divine . 
&quot; it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism and the people started to think about believing that creativity is completely different from their own individual . 
for the first time in history , you hear people hear this or that artist , a genius , call it , instead of being a genius . 
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake . 
you know , i think a mere person would allow him to think he or she is , like the vessel , like the basin , and the essence , and the source , of all divine creative , unknown , infinite mystery , is a little bit too much responsibility to give them a fragile human psyche . 
it &apos;s like somebody asking you to see the sun swallowing . 
this distorts and distorts entire ego and it creates all of these unattainable expectations of the world 
&apos;s success . i think that this pressure to succeed , our artists over the last 500 years , has destroyed . 
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true , the question is : 
can we change it ? 
maybe to an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the world &apos;s mystery of creative return . 
maybe not . 
maybe we can use the idea of 500 years of rational humanism not just in an 18 @-@ minute talk . 
and there is certainly people in this audience who really are justified scientific doubts about how to register about the idea of basically fairies , people who follow people , and fairy @-@ birds on their projects , etc . 
i &apos;m probably not going to see all of you take this trip . 
but the question i raise is that the reason why not ? 
why not think about it ? 
because it &apos;s just as much sense as anything else from the one i &apos;ve heard when it comes to getting the absolutely crazy @-@ dozing whim @-@ heartedness of the creative process explained . 
a process that , like everyone knows , is ever trying to do something about it . so , in other words , everyone here , not always sensible , is 
actually doing something about it . in fact , he can sometimes feel almost paranormal . 
i recently had such an encounter as i saw the extraordinary american poet ruth stone meet with the now @-@ over 90 , which is her , but who &apos;s been a poet throughout her life . she told me that when she was in virginia , she grew up in the village , she was working outside in the fields , she said she would feel and hear a poem about the landscape coming up to her . 
she said it was like a thundering train from the air . 
the information about the country is rolling to you . 
she felt when it came , because it would make the earth under her feet tremble to the ground . 
she knew she was in such a moment , only doing one thing , and that was in her words , &quot; race like the devil . &quot; 
she ran like the devil to the house while she was running from this poem . it went only to the fact that she was quick enough to make a sheet of paper and a pen so that she could get it when it was going through it thunder , catch it and put it on the sheet . 
in other paintings , she was not fast enough , she ran and ran and ran , but she reached the house , not and the poem rolled through her . and she ran and missed it . she said it would continue to go over land and how she said it would go after another poet , looking for a different poet . 
and then there was these moments , the part i &apos;ll never forget , she said , it &apos;s been moments in which she was almost almost missing . 
so she runs to the house and looks for the paper and the poem goes through the house , and she runs through it , and she takes a pen straight when it goes through it , and then she said , &quot; it &apos;s like she &apos;s going to grab it with her other hand and grab it . 
she caught the poem on his tail and pulled it back . she pulled it back into her body and took it on the paper . 
in these occasions , the poem came perfectly and intact on the paper . but backwards , from the last word to the first . 
when i heard that , i thought , &quot; this is scary . &quot; that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is going on . 
that &apos;s not like my creative work . i &apos;m not like the channel . 
i am a mule to work . i have to do every day to work at the same time , and sweat , weep , and really torment me unpleasantly . 
but even i in my mule species sometimes have this thing striped . 
and i guess that many of you think that &apos;s 
what they did . even i had work or ideas that came from a source through me , which i had really not identified , which i could not identify . 
what is that ? 
and how do we get into relationship with it without having to understand our mind , but rather , even with the spiritual health , keeping ourselves ? 
for me , the best living example is how to do this . &quot; the musician tom waits , i was allowed to see him for a few years ago for a magazine . 
we talked about this topic and we know you what the commission &apos;s work is doing most of its life . tom , the embodiment of the tormented modern artist , who tried to get these uncontrollable creative impulses that lived in him and to cope with them . 
but then he grew older and quieter , and he told me that he would one day be on a highway in los angeles , and there he changed everything for a guy . 
he went with high speed when he suddenly saw a small fragment of a melody that was like it was with inspirations , often for him . tormenting , hard to grasp , and he wants to have it . it &apos;s magnificent . he &apos;s leaking after it , but he can &apos;t grasp it . 
he has no piece of paper , he has no pen , he has no cassette recorder . 
it starts with this old anxiety in him , rising like a little like , &quot; i &apos;m going to lose this thing , &quot; and i &apos;m going to be persecuted forever by this song . 
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not able to . but 
instead of panic , i heard him just stop . 
he finished the whole course of thought and did something completely new . 
he just looked at the sky and said , &quot; excuse me , can &apos;t you see i &apos;m driving a car ? &quot; 
i see it as if i could just see a song writing down . 
if you really want to exist , come to a more favorable moment again , if i &apos;m looking after you . 
if not tortures , today someone else . 
go and torment leonard cohen 
his entire work process has changed afterwards . 
not the work itself , which was still often so dark as it was ever before . 
but the process and the heavy grief that made it around was lifted when he saw the genius coming out of himself . where he had nothing but trouble , and he was going to leave him where he came from , so to speak , he realized that there was no inner tormenting thing to be . 
it could be a strange , miraculous , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the alien external thing that wasn &apos;t quite tom . 
when i read this story , i changed it to a little bit , the way i worked and it got it to me before . 
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of the writing process of eat pray love . i fell into one of these ducts of doubt that we all fall into when we think we &apos;re working on something and it doesn &apos;t work . you &apos;re catching up to think that it &apos;s going to be a disaster , that &apos;s the worst book ever written . 
not only bad , but the worst of all times . 
i started thinking , &quot; i should be just stamping the project . 
but then i remembered that i was thinking about tom in the open sky . and i was trying to . 
i therefore raised my gaze from the manuscript and spoke my comment in the direction of an empty corner of space . 
i spoke loudly , &quot; hear , you , thing , you , and i both know if this book isn &apos;t brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ? &quot; 
because you see that i &apos;m all that i have , i &apos;m investing , i &apos;m not more than that . 
if you don &apos;t know better , you have to cross up here and increase your share of the deal . okay , 
but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what the hell is doing with it . 
i will continue to write , because that &apos;s my job . 
and i would ask for a record that i am voting for my part today on the job here . 
because in the end , it &apos;s like this : centuries ago , in the deserts of north africa , people turned to moonlight festivals with sacred dances and music held for hours , until dawn . 
these festivals were always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic . 
but back and forth , very rarely , something special happened , one of the actors actually became superworldly . 
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know that you all know that you &apos;re already in your life , and you &apos;ve seen this kind of performance . 
it was as if the time was standing still and the dancer was going through a kind of gate , he did nothing but he ever did it before . &quot; &#91; 1,000 nights earlier , but everything added up together . &#93; 
and suddenly , he didn &apos;t appear any longer purely human . 
he was taken from within and illuminated from below , and everything illuminated himself through a light of god . 
when this was the case , the people knew what that was , they called it &quot; at its name . &quot; 
they put their hands together and started to sing : &quot; allah , allah , god , god , god . &quot; 
that is god . you know . 
interesting historical footnote when the ethiopian southern spain conquered , they brought this custom with them : the debate changed over the course of the centuries from allah , allah , to olé , olé , olé , which is still used in bullfights and flamenco dances . 
if a performer in spain could find something impossible , something magical , allah olé olé allah , great bravo , incomprehensible , there it is a volatile look at god . 
and that &apos;s great , because we need that . 
but the tricky part follows the next morning , when the dancer himself wakes up and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday . and he &apos;s no longer a little five @-@ fold from god in himself . 
he &apos;s just an aging mortal with painful knees and maybe he &apos;s going to never again become these heights . 
and maybe never again will anyone be able to call god &apos;s name when it turns , but what should he do with the rest of his life ? 
that &apos;s hard . 
that &apos;s one of the most painful corrections to a creative life . 
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of pain if you &apos;re going to be unbelieving from the beginning that the most extraordinary aspects of your life would come from you . 
if you might just believe that you have a loan from the agency , from an unimaginable source for a fine time of your life that is connected to someone else , if you &apos;re done with it . 
if we start to think about it , it changes all . 
so i started to think and think , so i think , certainly , in the past few months , while i &apos;m thinking of the book that &apos;s going to be published soon , when the dangerous , frightening , much @-@ awaited successor of my departed success . 
what i &apos;m constantly saying to myself when i talk about it crazy is , &quot; don &apos;t be afraid . 
don &apos;t be discouraged , just do your job . 
be still responsible for your contribution , as whatever he is , whatever . 
if your job is dancing , dance . 
if the stupid divine genius , the genius that is standing by you , decides for a short moment to have a touch of miracles through your effort to show you , then olé . 
and if not , dance your dance . 
and olé : for you , despite all this . 
i believe that , and i have the feeling that we should teach that . 
olé : for you , despite all this , just for you to be the mere human love and attachment there , to be there . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
june cohen olé 
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about human genome , and what the meaning is , and about the human discovery of new groups of genes . in fact , 
we &apos;re starting from a new point , and we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to move from digital code to a new phase of biology , by creating new life and building new life . 
we have always tried to answer important questions . 
what is life ? it &apos;s something i think is that many biologists are trying to do to understand and understand that on different levels . 
we have different approaches to make it possible , except for the 
minimum components , to simplify it . we have nearly 20 years of digitization when we &apos;ve sequenced the human genome , and the change from the analogue to the analog world of biology to the digital world , the computer , was going to be . 
now we &apos;re trying to ask if we &apos;re able to regenerate life , or if we &apos;re able to create new life from this digital universe . that 
&apos;s the map of a small organism , mycoplasma geitalium , which is the smallest genome in a species that has itself in the lab replicated , and we &apos;ve tried to see if we could do this with an even smaller genome . 
we have managed to get to about one hundred genes out of the 500 or so genes , which are here . 
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to what we trust , you tell me , that &apos;s simple , but if we all look at these genes that we have one after the other eliminated , it &apos;s simple , it &apos;s very unlikely that this will lead to a living cell . 
so we have decided that it will be the only way to move forward , this chromosome , actually , synthesize what we can do , which allows us to vary the individual components , and so we can ask some of these fundamental questions . 
and so we started to talk to the question , &quot; can we synthesize a chromosome ? 
&quot; allows the chemistry to really make these really big molecules , which is never before done before . 
and if we can do that , we can start the chromosome . 
a chromosome is , by the way , just a piece of inert chemical material . 
our steps in digitization of life and our steps were exponential . 
our ability to use genetic code has changed a lot slowly . but still , it has increased , and our last point would now be an exponential curve . 
we have 15 years ago started with it . 
it actually took a few years , starting with a bioethical review , before we started the first experiments . 
how it turned out , dna synthesization is very difficult . 
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that are small pieces of dna that can make 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a degenerative process , so the longer you make a piece , the more errors happen . 
so we had to use a new method to develop this new little piece of stuff , and we had to correct the mistakes . 
that was our first attempt , starting with the digital information of the genome phi x 174 . 
it &apos;s a small virus that can kill bacteria . 
we created small pieces , made a bug correction , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters . 
the exciting phase came when we saw this piece of inert chemistry and we went into a bacterium and we got the bacterium started to use genetic code to read and make viral particles . 
the viral particles were then removed from the cells and came to the back and killed e. coli . 
recently , i started working with the oil industry , and they said that they were going to understand this model . 
they laughed more than they were here . &quot; so we think we think that this is a situation where software is actually the software &apos;s own hardware that can build , in a biological system . 
but we wanted to go a lot further , we wanted to have a whole bacterial chromosome built , it has more than 580,000 letters of genetic code . so we thought we &apos;re building it in cassettes of the size of the virus , which is what we &apos;re going to vary the size of the cassettes to understand what the individual components of a living cell are . 
design is the key , and if you &apos;re using digital information in the computer , you have to start this digital information really flawlessly . 
when we saw the genome sequenced for the first time in 1995 , the error rate was 10 000 pairs of bases . 
we found a 30 error when resequencing , if we were to use the original sequence , it would never have been possible to go up . 
part of the design is to make pieces . 50 pieces that contain 50 letters long and the ones that are 50 letters overlap pieces to create smaller sub @-@ units . so that they fit together . 
we have unique elements built in here . 
you may have heard that we &apos;re installing watermarks . 
think about it . we have a 4 @-@ letter code a , c , g and t . 
triplets of these letters , these letters encode about 20 amino acids , and here &apos;s a single determination for each of these amino acids . 
so we can actually use the genetic code to translate our words into phrases , thoughts . 
at first we only signed . 
some people were disappointed that there was no poetry . 
we have the pieces constructed in such a way that we can easily break them down with enzymes , and there are enzymes that repair and reintegrate them . 
and we started to play pieces . starting with pieces that were five to seven thousand letters , we added these pieces to each other to make 24,000 letters pieces to make them rejoin them , up to 72 000 . 
in every step , we have these pieces in surplus , so that we can sequence them , because we tried to make a very robust process , which they did in a minute , and we &apos;ll see . 
we tried to get to the point of automation . 
so that looks like a basketball playoff . 
if we go to these really big pieces , with over 100 000 base pairs , then these are not just going to be growing in e.coli , it &apos;s going to exceed all the possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we turned to other mechanisms . 
we knew of a mechanism that the homologist called recombination , called the biology that biology uses to make dna repair that could repair those pieces that could fit together . 
here &apos;s an example of this : there &apos;s an organism called deinococcus radiodurans , which has three million wheel of radiation . 
you see , in the upper field , that his chromosome just falls apart . 
12 to 24 hours later , the whole thing has been assembled together again as it was . 
we have thousands of organisms doing this , and we have thousands of organisms . 
these organisms can be totally dried up , and they can even live in vacuum . 
i am absolutely sure that life in space exists and that life is moving , on the quest for aquatic conditions , in search of . 
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of of it out there . 
here &apos;s a picture of the molecule that we &apos;re producing . by doing this process , we &apos;ve actually actually got this process , we &apos;ve only used yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces , we &apos;ve adapted them . yeast then automatically adds them together . 
that &apos;s not an electron microscope , it &apos;s a regular microscope image . 
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even do it with the light microscope . 
these are recordings of a duration of 6 seconds . 
that &apos;s the publication we &apos;re only recently finalising . 
these are over 580,000 letters to the genetic code , it &apos;s the largest molecule with a defined structure , which ever has been created by humans . it has a molecular 
weight of over 300 million . 
if we deal with a font size of 10 and without spacing , we would have to print 142 pages , just to print this genetic code . 
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ? 
obviously , it &apos;s a virus that &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s a lot more complicated with bacteria . 
it is also easier to do it in eukaryotes , as we do . if you do , you just take the nucleus out and give it another one in , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;re all talking about cloning . 
in archaebacteria , the chromosome is integrated into the cell , but it &apos;s just recently that we &apos;ve shown that you can actually see a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another , and you can activate it . 
we cleaned the chromosome of a microbial species . roughly speaking , these two are as far from each other as humans and mice . we gave some extra genes to make us choose this chromosome , we decomposed it with enzymes to destroy all proteins and destroy it , and it was very amazing when we put it in a cell , and they &apos;re going to be our very mature graphics here . 
the new chromosome went into the cell . 
in fact , we thought that the end is here , but we tried to make the process a little bit further . 
that &apos;s the main mechanism of evolution here . 
we find all kinds of species here , which are a second chromosome that has been taken up , or a third of where every time thousands of characteristics are recorded in just one second , adding to a species . 
so people who are imagining evolution as a gene that &apos;s going to be changed at a time have a lot of biology missed . 
there are enzymes that are called restrictive enzymes that actually digest dna . 
the chromosome that is in the cell has no one , the chromosomes that we inserted , has already . 
it was built in the cell and realized that the other chromosome was a foreign material , digested it , and so we had at the end only one cell with a new chromosome . 
it turned blue because of the genes that we inserted . 
and after a very short time , it had all the characteristics of the species lost and completely converted into a new species based on the species , based on the new software that we gave into the cell . 
all proteins changed , the membranes changed , changed when we saw the genetic code , it was exactly that , what we transferred was . 
it may seem like genomic alchemy , but we can do it by using the software dna to move things quite dramatically . 
now i have argued that this is not genesis , the genesis , which is based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and i &apos;ve argued that we might be doing this , and we &apos;re going to have a new kind of cambrian explosion that is going to create massive new species formation based on this digital design . 
why should we do that ? 
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we &apos;re going to need . 
we are in the process of being six and a half to nine billion people in the next 40 years . 
to get it in my context , i was born in the year 1946 . 
today , three people are on this planet for everyone who &apos;s been living in 1946 , within a 40 @-@ year period , four will be there . 
we have problems with food , fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6.5 billion dollars people . 
it will be a challenge to do this for 9 . 
we need more than five billion tons of coal , 30 @-@ plus billion barrels of oil , which is a hundred million barrels a day . 
if we talk about biological processes or any process to get the process replaced , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge . 
then of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material that &apos;s in the atmosphere . 
we now have a look at the world of our discoveries , a database of about 20 million genes and i think i want to believe that these are the design components of the future . 
the electronics industry had a dozen components and you can see the diversity of the things that came about . 
we are encountering this first and foremost in the borders of biological reality and in those of our ideas . 
we have technologies today because of this fast synthesis method to make this happen , which we can call combinatorial genetics . 
we now have the opportunity to have a big robot built that can take millions of chromosomes a day , and we can do it . 
if you imagine this 20 million dollar difference in gene production , or if you want to optimize these processes to make octane , or if you want to make drugs , new vaccines , we can change molecular biology with a small team , just a little bit more than the last 20 years of science . 
and it &apos;s just male selection . we can look for viability , we can select chemicals or fuel production , vaccine production , and so on . 
that &apos;s a recording of real design software on which we work , with which you can actually sit down and create new species on the computer , you know . 
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like , we know exactly what their genetic code will look like . 
we focus now on fuel from the fourth generation . 
you have recently seen corn grow into ethanol , which is just a bad experiment . 
we have been using second and third generation fuels , which are coming out relatively soon , which will have much higher sugar @-@ making activities , like octane or different types of butanol . 
but as we think , the only way we can do this is to make biology have a big impact without further increasing food costs or limiting their availability . if you have biology , if you think we see co2 as the raw material , and so we &apos;re working on cells that go that way . 
and we think that we &apos;re going to start using the fourth generation of fuels , and we &apos;re going to be about 18 months . 
sunlight and co2 are a method . 
but in our discovery of the world , we &apos;ve all seen different methods . 
that &apos;s an organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 . 
he lives in the deep sea , about one and a half miles deep , at almost boiling water temperatures . 
it converts co2 into methane , under the use of hydrogen , as an energy source . 
we investigate whether we can use stored co2 , which is easy to produce places . converts to the co2 in the fuel to convert this process to 
drive it . within a short period of time , we believe that we can be able to build one of the fundamental questions of life . you 
know , we really have moderate targets like replacing the new system of petrochemical industry , exactly when you don &apos;t do this at ted , where else would be a major source of energy ? 
but just as we &apos;re working on doing the same thing at the moment to develop vaccines . 
you have it this year with the flu , we &apos;re here , we &apos;re always one year behind , and we &apos;ve got a dollar too little when it comes to the right vaccine . 
i think that this will be changed by changing recombinant vaccines . 
that &apos;s how the future might be . with the changes that can be made today , the evolutionary tree can be accelerated , with synthetic bacteria , archaea , and possibly eukaryotes . 
we are light years away from getting people better , and our goal is to just make us have a chance to have a long enough chance to survive , to possibly do that . thank you . 
what i &apos;m going to tell you first as quickly as possible is the basic work , a new technology that we need to use microsoft as part of a takeover just a year ago , 
which is seadragon . and it &apos;s an environment where people can either eat locally or away with huge amounts of food and visual data , and they can do it . 
we see many , many gigabytes of digital photos here , which you can seamlessly and continuously get up to , swivel in any way you can rearrange . 
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at , how big these collections are , or how big the images are . 
most of them are digital photos of a camera , but this one is about , for example , a scan of the congress library , and it &apos;s in an area of 300 megapixels . 
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that makes the performance of a system like this can limit is the number of pixels on your screen in . every moment , 
it also has a very flexible architecture . 
this is a whole book , an example of non @-@ image data . 
that &apos;s bleak house of dickens . every column is a chapter . 
to prove that there is really a question of a text and not a text , not a picture , we can do something like that , to really show that it &apos;s a real representation of the text and not an image , and we can do something like that . 
maybe this is an artificial way of writing an e @-@ book . 
i would not recommend it . 
this is a more realistic case , and this is an output of the guardian . 
every big picture is the beginning of a section . 
and that gives them really the pleasure and the good experience of having a real paper edition of a magazine or a newspaper to read what &apos;s in itself a kind of medium with several orders of magnitude . 
we also have something to do at the corner of this special edition of the guardian . 
we have a false message with very high resolution , which we have drafted much higher than in a normal ad , and we have additional information about it . 
if you want to use the features of this car , you can see them here . 
or other models , or even technical specifications . 
and this really does take up these ideas , these restrictions on the space available on the screen , to abolish . 
we hope that this will not be pop @-@ ups and other nonsense anymore , and that should not be necessary . 
of course , mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this . 
and i want to really not do much time here , except to say that we also have to go to this area . 
but these are all streets in the u 
@-@ s , a. upstairs , on the ground 
@-@ floor image of nasa . let us now have something else to pick up . 
that &apos;s even live now on the internet . you can check it out . 
this is a project that &apos;s called photosynth , which really has two different technologies that connect . 
one is seadragon and the other is seadragon , and the other is a very good research on computer vision that is done by noah snavely , a university student at washington university , under steve seitz &apos;s advice at uw . 
and rick szeliski from microsoft , research was carried out a very good collaboration . 
so this is live on the internet , it &apos;s powered by seadragon . 
you can see that when we see this kind of view created , where we &apos;re going to pass through images , and this experience of multiple resolution , we can do this . 
but the spatial arrangement of the images is here in fact in the meaning . 
the computer vision algorithms have captured these images together so that they can give the real space in which these recordings , all of which are located near grassi lakes in the canadian rockies , correspond to the real space in which they were made . you see elements of stabilized slides or panoramic image processing , and these things were all spatially related to each other . 
i don &apos;t know exactly if i still have time to give you other environments . 
there are those who have much more spatial space . 
i would like to make a straight one of the original records of noah , and that &apos;s from an early prototype of photosynth , where we first started to work in the summer to give you that to show you what i think it really is that it &apos;s the point behind this technology of photosynth technology , and this is not necessarily so obvious when you look at the environments that we &apos;re looking at on the website . 
we had to look at the lawyers , etc . 
this is a reconstruction of notre cathedral . dame , which is built exclusively in computer . with pictures by flickr , they give 
you just notre dame in flickr , and they put you pictures of men in flickr t @-@ shirts and on the university grounds , etc . 
get each of these orange cone represents an image that is seen as being belonging to this model . 
so this is all flickr images , and they &apos;re all spatially on this way , in this way , in relation to each other . and 
we can &apos;t wait for this very simple way . 
you know , i never believed that i would eventually be working at microsoft . 
i am very grateful for the welcome here . 
i guess you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras , everything is about it from the cell phone camera to professional slrs , a pretty large number of them all in this environment , all of them flicked together . and 
if possible , i &apos;ll get some of the strange ones , many of them are covered with faces , etc . 
somewhere here are a number of photographs here , and they &apos;re . 
this is actually a poster of notre dame , which is recorded correctly . 
we can expect the poster to be a physical view of this environment . 
the point here is that we &apos;re doing things with the social environment . 
it &apos;s going to be data from all of you . from the entire collective memory , how visually the earth looks like , and everything is going to be connected . 
all these photos are connected to each other , and there &apos;s something bigger than the one that &apos;s the sum of the parts . 
you will receive a model that comes from all over the world . 
look at this as the continuation of the work of stephen lawler on virtual earth . 
and that &apos;s something that &apos;s going to be done by the complexity that people use it , and it &apos;s growing and its benefits for the user with the application are getting bigger and bigger . 
your own photos are taken with metadata that shows a different person entering another person . 
if someone wants to make the effort and to get all these saints labeled and communicated , who they all are , then the way i take my photo of notre dame cathedral suddenly becomes familiar with all these data , and i can see them as the starting point to go to this room , dive into this metaverse , take the photos of other people , and so i can use some kind of cross @-@ modal social experience with the use of other providers . 
and of course by @-@ product , all of this is the immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the world that are not only superfluous or satellite images , and so on , but also collective memory . 
thank you . 
chris anderson : i understand you right . your software allows you to get a certain time within the next few years , all the images that someone in the world has used together in principle , basically , to be connected . 
baa : yes , she does nothing but discover when you want created it . hyperlinks between the pictures . 
and she does this because of the content in the pictures . 
and that &apos;s really exciting when you &apos;re going to see the abundance of semantic information that many of these images have . 
how if you want to find a web search for images where you enter sentences and the text of the website contains a lot of information about what image that is ? but 
how about it if the picture you were using with all your pictures ? then 
the scope of semantic cross @-@ connection and abundance , which is derived from it , is really . huge , 
it &apos;s a classic network effect . 
ca blaise : that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations , baa . have 
you . thank you very much . you know , one of the big neglect when traveling , and one of the joys of ethnographic research is , together with people , to live together , who are still interested in the old days , who can remember their past , which are still feeling the wind , they &apos;re on rocks smoothed by the rain , they &apos;re touching the bitter leaves of the plants . 
just know that jaguar shamans are still beyond the milky way , or that the meaning of myths , the elders of inuit , is still of great importance , or that in the himalayas , buddhists are still breathing the dharma breath . is it the dharma &apos;s central revelation of anthropology in memory that means calling the mind ? that &apos;s the thought that the world is in which we live , not in an absolute sense , but only as an absolute as a result 
of a group of certain possibilities of adaptation , which our ancestors , although successful many generations ago , chose . 
and of course , we all share the same adaptive needs . 
we will all be born , we bring children to the world . 
we go through initiation rituals . 
we must deal with the unstoppable separation by the death of the child , and so it should not surprise us that we all sing , dance and dance and bring forth art . 
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique tone of the song , the rhythm of dance in every culture . 
and it doesn &apos;t matter if it &apos;s a matter of the penan in the forests of borneo , or whether it &apos;s the voodoo acolytes in haiti , or the warriors in the kaisut desert of northern kenya , the curanderos in the andes , or a caravan factory in the middle of the sahara , this is by chance the colleague i met a month ago in the desert , or even a yak shepherd on the slopes of qomolang@@ everest 
, the mother of god of the world 
all these people teach us that it &apos;s still other ways of life , other ways of thinking , other ways of orientating ourselves on earth . 
and that &apos;s an idea that , if you think about it , you can only fill it with hope . 
together , the countless cultures of the world form a network of spiritual and cultural life that is the encircled earth and is responsible for the good of the earth , as important as the biological network of life that is known as the biosphere . 
you can &apos;t imagine this cultural network of life as an ethnosphere , and ethnosphere can be seen as the total sum of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations , and intuitions that have been influenced by human imagination since the beginning of consciousness . 
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity . 
it is the symbol of all that we are and what we want to see as amazing , curious species . 
and just like the biosphere is strongly removed , this happened with the ethnosphere , only with the even greater speed . 
no biologist would , for example , dare to claim that 50 or more of all kinds are just before extinction , because it &apos;s simply not true , and yet this is the most apocalyptic scenario on the field of biodiversity . hardly any of what is happening to us as the most optimistic scenario in the field of cultural diversity is known . 
and the decisive indicator is that the extinction of languages . 
when each of them in this room was born , the children of the earth were given 6000 languages . 
now , a language is not just the whole of vocabulary or a series of grammar rules . 
a language is an expression of the human mind . 
it &apos;s a means of making the soul of a particular culture accessible to the material world , and it &apos;s a means of making it happen . 
every language is like an old forest of spirit , a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities . 
and of these 6000 languages , today , while we &apos;re here in monterey , we &apos;re sitting here , half of them are no longer in the ears of kids . 
they &apos;re not going to teach toddlers any more , that is , if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead . 
what could be more lonely than the silence enveloping you ? a man of the last of your people to be your language speaking , no possibility to have the wisdom of the ancestors passed on , or hope to be children , 
and yet this terrible fate is actually happening to someone somewhere on earth , about two or so weeks , because of every two weeks , an older person dies and takes the last syllables of an old language with him into the tomb . 
and i know that some of you say , &quot; is it not better ? &quot; so the world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we all had one language to speak , and i say , &quot; well , let this language be yoruba . &quot; let it be cantonal . 
let kogi be . 
and then they would suddenly see how it would be if they could have their own language not 
spoken . i would therefore like to draw your attention today to a journey through the ethnosphere , a short journey through the ethnosphere around it , trying to make you understand what the real loss actually has been . 
now there are some of us who are , in a sense , forgotten that when i say , i really have different ways of being , different ways of being , my ways of being . 
take to the place , for example , this child , the barasana , in the northwest of the amazon . the anaklona people believe that they mythologically believe that the flow of milk from the east came up in the belly of holy snakes . 
that &apos;s a people who don &apos;t cognitively distinguish between the colors blue and green , because the sky tent is similar to the forest that people depend on , and that &apos;s what people call the sky tent . 
you have a strange language and a marriage rule , linguistic exogamy , called linguistic exogamy , you have to marry someone who has another language . 
all of this is rooted in the mythological past , the peculiarity of these great houses , where , due to mixed marriages , six or seven languages are spoken , is that you never hear someone who has a language . 
you only listen and start to hear , and then talk . 
or one of the most fascinating tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived with , the waorani , in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people that first came to contact peacefully in 1958 . 
in 1957 , five missionaries tried to get in touch and made a serious mistake . 
they threw shiny photos of themselves . what they did was they threw them down from the air , which we would rate as a kind gesture , and they forgot that these people from the rainforest in their lives had never seen anything two @-@ dimensional . 
they raised these photographs from the forest floor , tried to get behind the face or figure , found nothing and found conclusion that this was business cards of the devil and killed the five missionaries with the five spear . 
but the waorani didn &apos;t just kill outsiders with the spear . 
they drilled each other . 
54 % of deaths were caused by drillings . 
we followed geneaology eight generations back , and we found two cases of a natural death and when we saw people , with emphasis , say something about it , they gave us that one of the people , who had grown so old that he was so old that he died because of his age , and we killed him anyway with the spear , but at the same time they had a clear knowledge of the forest that was amazing . 
your hunters could not see the urine of an animal 40 steps away and determine how to smell and determine the animal species it belonged to . 
in the early 1980s , i got a really amazing job . when i was taught by my professor at harvard , i asked myself if i was interested in going to haiti and to see secret societies infiltrate the secret societies that were the foundation of duvalier &apos;s strength and tone , macoutes , and the poison that used to get used to zombies . 
to make sure . to make this sensation sense , i had to , of course , learn something about this remarkable faith of vodoun , and voodoo is not a cult of black magic . 
on the contrary , it is a complex metaphysical worldview . 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if i ask you , the big world religions would list , &quot; what would you say ? 
&quot; christianity , islam , buddhism , judaism or whatever . 
a continent is always left out , because the presumption was that it was not religious in black africa . of course , there was one and voodoo is just the remnant of this very profound religious thought , which was during the tragic diaspora of the slavery era . 
but what voodoo is so interesting is this living relationship between the two living and the living and the dead . 
the living give birth to the spirits . 
the spirits can be heard from under the great water . answers to the rhythm of the dance to the soul . to save the soul of the living temporarily , so that the acolyth is for a short , shining moment to god . 
deshab : &quot; the voodooists like to say , &quot; your white ones go to church and talk about god . &quot; 
we dance in the temple and become god . 
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to be taken by the spirit . how can you be hurt ? 
see these amazing demonstrations , voodoo @-@ acolyths , in a trance state , the glowing coal without burning , grabbing an amazing illustration of the ability of the mind to influence the body in such a way that it can endure it when it enters a state of extreme arousal . 
now , of all the people i &apos;ve met , the kogi were from sierra nevada , de santa marta , in northern colombia , the most extraordinary . 
descendants of the ancient tyrannical civilization that the caribbean coastal plain of colombia populated and subsequently became part of the conquest , this people settled in a isolated volcanic massif , isolated from the surface of the caribbean coast . 
in a bloodstained continent , these people were the only people who never had been conquered by the spaniards . 
until today , the commission is still working on a ritual priesthood that will allow formation as a priesthood , but it is very extraordinary . 
the young acolyths are born at the age of three and four by their families , separated from them and buried in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the foot of the glaciers for 18 years . two periods of nine years each deliberately chosen to reconstruct the nine months of pregnancy , which is what they had in their womb , their mother &apos;s womb , now they spend metamorphically in the womb of the great mother . 
and during all this time , they &apos;re culturally integrated into the values of their society , values that underline the claim that their prayers and prayers are only their prayers , the cosmic or we could say that the ecological balance is maintained . 
at the end of this amazing initiation , you will suddenly be going to take one day out and for the first time in your life , at the age of 18 , you will see a sunrise , and in this crystal clear moment of consciousness , the first light , when the sun starts to climb onto the slopes of the amazingly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything you see learned in abstract becomes amazing splendor , confirmed and the priest steps up 
and down . and says , &quot; look , you know , it &apos;s really like i told you . 
it &apos;s so wonderful , you have to protect it . 
they call themselves the older brothers and say that we are the ones we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world , we are responsible . 
well , this level of intuition is very important . 
whenever we think about natives and landscapes , we conjure up either rousseau and the old town rumour of noble wild animals . what is in its simplification a racist thought , is it ? or thoreau and say , &quot; these people are more with nature than they are with us . 
&quot; so natives are neither sentimental nor will they be taken by nostalgia . 
it is not much space for it to be found in the malaria @-@ contaminated swamps of asmat or the cold winds of tibet . however , they have nevertheless a long and ritual mystery of the earth &apos;s nimbus , which is not based on the idea of consciously being close to her , but on a far more subtle intuition of the idea that the earth itself exists only because it exists in the human consciousness , inhales it . 
well , what does that mean ? 
it means that a little child from the andes is going to be the one who grows up in the belief that the mountain is an apu spirit that determines his or her destiny , a completely different person , and another relationship with this resource or resource or place will have a different relationship than a little child from montana , who in faith grows up to be a mountain , a pile of stones that can be removed . 
whether he is a abode of a spirit or a pile of brass is irrelevant . 
the interesting thing is the metaphor that makes the relationship between the individual and nature defined , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about . 
i grew up in the forests of british columbia and i believed that these forests would make it there . i rode to the forest . 
that made me a different person , than my friends , among the kwakiutl , who believe that these forests are the whereabouts of hukuk and hukuk and the curved beak of heaven and cannibal spirits , the ones that are at the northern end of the world , spirits that they participate in their hamatsa initiation . 
now , when you start to understand the idea that these cultures are different realities , they can create some of their extraordinary discoveries , for example , these plants here , you know . 
it &apos;s a photo i took just last april in the northwest of the amazon . 
this is ayahuasca from which many of you belong . that &apos;s the strongest psychoactive preparation from the repertoire of the shaman . 
what ayahuasca is so fascinating is not only the pharmacological potential of this preparation , but also the processing of it . it &apos;s really made up of two different sources : on the one hand , there &apos;s this wooden liane that has a number of beta @-@ carbolines , harmine , harmolin , slightly hallucinogen , which is just to take this climbing plant , is about as if a blue turmoil smoke is on its consciousness , but it &apos;s going to with the name psychotria viridis mixed 
. 
this plant contains some very strong tryptamins that are similar to serotonin , dimethyltryptamin @-@ 5 and methoxydimethyltryptamine . 
if you have ever seen the yanomami , how you can see this stuff snuff , this substance that you can get from different kinds of stuff , also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine . 
this powder to snuff is about the same as from a gun run shot at , lined by baroque paintings and paintings , and landing on a sea of electricity . it &apos;s not going to distort reality , but rather to dissolve the reality . 
i even talked to my professor richard evan shultes , the man who was the psychedelic area with the discovery of the magical mushrooms in mexico . in the 1930s , i started the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico . i said that you didn &apos;t classify these tryptamins as hallucinogen , because at the moment you saw the effects , you couldn &apos;t feel there anymore , you &apos;re there to experience a hallucination , but the 
because they are replaced by a human gut naturally occurring enzyme with a name called monoamine oxidase . 
you can only use the following links with some other chemicals orally : the substances that the mao denaturate . 
well , the fascinating thing is that the beta @-@ carbolins that are contained in the liane , the mao inhibitors , are exactly the kind of thing that &apos;s necessary to potenate the tryptamins . so , ask yourself . 
how can these people come from a flora of 80,000 species ? astringent plants , these two morphologically not related plants , find the two that , if this combined , can be a kind of biochemical version , so that the whole thing is larger than the sum of its parts . 
we use this great euphemism , try and mistake , which is insignificant . 
but if you ask the indians , &quot; say , &quot; the plant is talking to us . so 
what does that mean ? 
this tribe , the cofan , have 17 variants of ayahuasca that they all have at great distance in the forest , which are for our eyes considered to be a kind of thing . 
and then you ask them how they can change their taxonomy , and they say , &quot; i thought you understand something about plants . 
i mean , you know , nothing at all , and i said , &quot; no . so 
it turns out that you can see each of the 17 variants on full moon , and they sing to a single in different pitches , and you can see that . 
well , that doesn &apos;t give you a phd in harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting to count than stamina , now the problem is that even those who are among us who have sympathy for the difficult situation of the natives , they &apos;re considered orginian and colorful , they &apos;re somehow looking at the past , but they &apos;re somehow limiting the real world , that is , our world , progressing . 
so the fact is that you &apos;re going to look at the 20th century in 300 years , not for its wars or technical innovations , but rather for its wars or technical innovations , but rather for an era in which we were present , and the massive destruction of biodiversity and cultural diversity on earth , either actively supported or passively accepted , so the problem is not change . 
all cultures have always been interested in the dance with new ideas for life . 
and the problem is not technology , technology itself . 
the sioux indians heard no less sioux . sioux was the first to hear them bow and arrow tasks than the americans stopped doing . americans were the horses and horse cars they were 
doing . not change and technology threaten integrity . it &apos;s not the ethnosphere , it &apos;s power to change the ugly face of domination . 
and where ever you can get into the world , you can see , you &apos;ll discover that these cultures don &apos;t go down , they &apos;re dynamic living peoples whose lives are being made visible by recognizable forces that are being pushed out of their capacity to adapt , whether it &apos;s about the tremendous deforestation , in their home country , the penan , a nomadic people from southeast asia , sarawak , a people who were free a generation ago in 
the forest . and now to bondage and prostitution on the riverbank was humiliated by where they see that they can see that even the river with the mud is polluted , which is almost half borneo into the south china sea seems to float away from where the japanese freighter is floating on the horizon , ready to see their ship &apos;s rooms with raw tree trunks that they can fill with the forest or have taken away , as in the case of the yanomami . where 
it &apos;s disease carriers who are killed during the gold rush . 
or if we go up into the mountains of tibet , where i &apos;m looking for a lot of stuff , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of political dominance . 
you know , the genocide , the physical extinction of people , is generally condemned , but the ethnocide , the destruction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not condemned , but generally and widely regarded as part of a development strategy . 
and you can &apos;t see tibet &apos;s suffering if you don &apos;t understand it at the lowest level . 
i traveled with a young colleague , 6000 miles from chengdu , in western china , overseas through southeast tibet , to lhasa , and only when i came to lhasa , i saw the face behind the statistics , which you hear 6000 saints , monuments that were buried in debris and ashes , and 1.2 miles from people who were killed during the cultural revolution by the cadres , and i saw them . the father of 
this young man was called a follower of the panchen lama . 
that meant that he was killed during the chinese invasion immediately . 
his uncle fled with her holiness in the diaspora , people who were going to nepal . 
his mother was imprisoned as punishment for the persecution of the crime , to be wealthy . 
he was born at the age of two in prison , smuggled to get under her feet of rock . because she was not able to hide without him . 
the sister who had done this brave act was taken to an educational camp . 
one day she stepped out of the box accidentally on a maos bracelet , and for this violation she had to be in a heavy labour camp for seven years . 
suffering of tibet can be unbearable , but the redeeming spirit of people is something unforgettable . 
and in the end , we &apos;re really facing an election , and if we want to be in a monochromatic world of monotony , or in a polychromatic world of diversity . 
margaret mead : the great anthropologist said before she died that it was her greatest fear , that during the time we were heading towards a thread of uncreative generic worldview , we didn &apos;t just move the entire spectrum of human imagination to a narrowed way of thinking , we would not only see the whole spectrum of human imagination reduced , but that one day we would wake up from a dream and forget that there were ever other possibilities . 
and it &apos;s humiliating to think about the fact that our genus , maybe since 600,000 years , exists . 
the neolithic revolution , which has brought agriculture to us and has brought us to worship at this moment in the seed grain , the shaman &apos;s poetry , through the prose of the priesthood , replaced hierarchy , specialization , and surplus , found only 10,000 years ago . 
modern industrial world , as we see it , is barely 300 years old . 
well , this superficial story doesn &apos;t tell me that we &apos;re all responding to the challenges that we &apos;re facing in the next millennia , and we &apos;re going to have to face . 
if we look at these countless world cultures according to the meaning of humanity , they answer 10,000 different voices . 
and in this song , we will have the opportunity to rediscover that we &apos;re what we &apos;re , people with full consciousness who are aware of the importance of giving everyone the opportunity to see a space that thrives in all people and gardens , and it &apos;s great moments of the optimism . 
here &apos;s a photo that i took on the northern end of the baffin islands when i was traveling with inuits to the narwhal hunt , and this man , olaya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather . 
the canadian government is not always very good at dealing with the inuit , and during the 1950s , in the course of establishing our rule , we have forced them to move to settlements . the grandfather of 
this old man refused . 
the family , the fear of his life , took him all the weapons and all the tools . 
now you have to know that the inuit is not afraid of the cold , they used it to their advantage . 
the sliding rails of their sled were originally made of fish , wrapped in caricature skin . 
the grandfather of the man was not afraid of the arctic night or the blowing storm . 
he slipped out , let his pants out of seal fur down , and threw them in his hand , and when the feces started to freeze , he formed them into the shape of a knife . 
he sprayed saliva on the sides of the sewage knife , and when it was completely frozen , he struck a dog with it . 
he skinned the dog and improvised a tableware , took the skeleton of the dog , and improvised a sledge , stretched another dog on , and vanished over the ice floes with the fecal knife on the belt . 
so you can &apos;t get anything done and do anything , and this is in many ways a symbol of resistance from the inuit and all the natives on earth . 
the canadian government gave the inuit a new mandate in april 1999 to fully control an area . it is larger than california , and texas , together . 
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called nunavut . 
it &apos;s an independent area . you control all mineral deposits . 
an amazing example of how a nation , a state , can make reparation with its inhabitants 
and reach them . and ultimately , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are going to be at these distant goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not at all distant . 
you are the home countries of someone . 
they represent parts of human imagination that are in past times , and that are for all of us , dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , are part of the geography of hope . 
what we do at national geographic ultimately try is that we believe that politicians never have anything to achieve . 
we believe that polemics , we believe that polemics are not convincing , but we believe that storytelling is the world that can change , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in history , in the world . our website receives 35 million hits every month . 
156 nations send our tv channel . 
our magazines are being read by millions . 
and we &apos;re doing a number of trips to the ethnosphere , where we &apos;re going to see our audience in places of such cultural wonders that they &apos;re going to be blinded by what we see , and hopefully they &apos;re going to be one by one , the central revelation of anthropology , that this world has earned it in different ways to exist , that we have a way of life in a truly multicultural , pluralistic world 
. and when wisdom is of all men , to our common well @-@ being , can contribute . 
thank you . 
i &apos;m going to give you some things out of my book that deal with other things that you &apos;ve heard of , and try to make connections if you don &apos;t notice them . 
i would like to start with what i am calling official dogma . 
the official dogma of what ? 
the official belief of all western industrial societies . 
the official dogma is : if our goal is to maximize the welfare of our citizens , we will do so above all through maximizing the maximum freedom of individuals . 
the reason for this is that freedom is at and for itself valuable , meaningful and essential for the human being . 
if people have freedom , everyone acts as a self @-@ employed person to do things . they do things that maximize our common good , and nobody has to decide for us . 
the way to maximize freedom is to choose to maximize choices . 
the more choices people have , the more freedom , and the more freedom they have , the more common good they have . 
this is , i think , so deep rooted in us that there is no one in the sense of getting it questioned . 
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives . 
i &apos;ll give you some examples of what modern progress allows us to do . 
this is my supermarket , not a big one . 
just a short while to salad dressings . there are 
175 dressings in my supermarket when you have the 10 different native olive oils not counting and 12 balsamic vinegar varieties that you could buy to buy to a large number of your own salad dessings , in which unlikely , in the unlikely case , you don &apos;t like any of the 175 in the store . 
so this is how the supermarket works . 
then go to a electronics store to buy a stereo system , put together speakers , cd players , cassette recorders , radio amplifiers , and in this one electronics store , there are so many stereo systems . 
we can &apos;t get 6.5 million different stereo systems , from the components that are used in this business . 
you have to admit that this is a great selection . 
in other areas , the world of communication . 
there was a time when i was a boy , and there was every telephone service that you wanted to do as long as he came from ma bell . 
you rented the phone and bought it not . 
as a result , the phone was never broken . 
these days are over . 
we have now almost an infinite selection of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones . 
these are mobile phones of the future . 
my favorite is the one in the middle mp3 player , nasal hair trimmer and crème @-@ brû<unk> flambierer . 
and should you do that so far , not in your business , have you seen it ? be sure that you will soon . it brings people 
to the shops , and it &apos;s going to ask this question . 
do you know the answer to this question ? 
the answer is no . 
it is impossible to use a mobile phone that is not too much . 
for other areas of life that are much more important than shopping , the same goes for the explosion of choices . 
health care in the united states is not going to be the case any longer , because you go to the doctor , and he tells you what to do . 
instead , you go to the doctor and the doctor says to you , &quot; we could do a or b . &quot; 
a : has these advantages and risks ? 
b ) has these advantages and risks ? what do you want to do ? 
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot; 
the doctor says , &quot; a has these advantages and risks , and b has those advantages and risks . 
what do you want to do ? 
and they say , &quot; if you were me , doctor , what would you do ? &quot; 
and the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . 
the result is patient autonomy , which sounds like a good thing , but it shifts the load of responsibility for the human meeting . of decisions from someone who has something to know , namely from the doctor to someone who knows nothing and most likely is ill , and therefore not in the best condition , to decide , namely , the patient . 
there is an enormous marketing for prescription drugs for people like the one you and me , what if you think , no sense because we don &apos;t make it because we can &apos;t buy it . 
why do you advertise us if we don &apos;t buy ? 
because they expect us to tell the doctor closest morning , we &apos;ll call and make a change to the prescription . 
something so profound as our identity is now a question of the choice of how this foil shows . 
we don &apos;t inherit identity , we invent it . 
and we invent ourselves so often anew as we want . 
so , every day , when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be . 
in terms of marriage and family , once the standard assumption was almost everyone had one and one married so quickly that they got so fast and so quickly children as one could . 
the only true choice was who didn &apos;t , when and not what they did afterwards . 
today , everything is easy to have . 
i teach wonderfully intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work than before . 
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , or because they &apos;re less careful . 
but because they &apos;re dealing with other things , they &apos;re asking themselves , &quot; should i marry or not ? &quot; now . 
or later , i &apos;m supposed to have kids , or i &apos;m going to make a career . they &apos;re 
all engaging questions . 
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , even if they don &apos;t do their tasks and don &apos;t have a good grade in my course . 
and you should do this in fact . that &apos;s important . 
work : we are blessed , as carl has pointed out , with the technology that allows us to do every minute , every day , from every place on the planet to the randolph hotel . 
there are also a corner from the one i don &apos;t tell anybody about , where the wlan works . 
i don &apos;t say anything , because i want to use it . 
this incredible freedom of choice in terms of work , decisions on making , re @-@ and @-@ making and re @-@ working , whether we should work or not . 
we can help our children play football , watch with our mobile phone on one hip , and our blackberry on the other hip , and our laptop , probably on our lap . 
and even if they all are switched off every minute in the world we give our child a chance to mutilate a football game , we also ask ourselves , &quot; should i take this call ? 
&quot; the email answers the letter . 
and even if the answer to the question &quot; no &quot; is , it will change your experience from your child &apos;s football game , very differently than it would have been . 
everywhere we look , big and small things , material things , and lifestyle , life is a question of choice . 
and the world in which we lived saw so much . 
this is what i want to say : there were some choices , but not everything was a matter of choice . 
and the world in which we &apos;re now living sees it look like this . 
and the question is , are the good or bad news ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it . 
all these choices have two effects : two negative effects on people . 
one effect paradoxically is that it &apos;s paralyzing instead of liberating . 
with so many options from which you can choose , it falls to people very hard to get involved in deciding at all . 
i &apos;m going to give you another drastic example of this : a study on investment in voluntary retirement provision . 
a colleague of mine had access to investment files from vanguard , the giant fund company of about one million employees , and about 2000 different jobs . 
and what she found was , per 10 investment funds that the employer offered , the participation was increased by 2 percent . 
they offer 50 investment funds , 10 percent fewer employees , participate than if they were just 5 percent offering , why ? 
because it has 50 investment funds that are available to choose from , it &apos;s so hard to decide which to choose from , that they can choose to postpone it tomorrow . 
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow , of course , never comes . 
understand that the problem is not just that of human dog food , if you eat in the retirement , because you &apos;re not enough money to get back . it &apos;s meaning it &apos;s also making decisions , so hard to make them big investment offers of their employers . 
the non @-@ participation gives you up to 5000 us $ per year on from the $ 5 million employer who has been happy to contribute to increasing . 
paralysis is a consequence of too many choices . 
and i think it &apos;s a matter of making the world look like this : you want to make the decision right when it comes to all eternity , right ? 
you don &apos;t want to get the wrong investment fund , or even the wrong salad dressing ? 
so that &apos;s one effect of the other effect , the other effect is that even if we overcome paralysis and have a decision , we end up less satisfied with the result of choosing than when we go beyond the possibility of having the opportunity to choose between fewer choices . 
and there are several reasons for this . one of them 
is conditioned by the great selection of different salad dressings . if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect and which salad dressing is already perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you &apos;re going to make a different decision . 
even if there is a good decision . 
the more opportunities there are , the easier it is to do nothing at all to regret - that &apos;s disappointing for the choice you make . 
secondly , what economists call oppertunity costs . dan 
gilbert has a big point today , this morning , by telling how much the world is going to do in which we evaluate things depends on what we &apos;re going to compare it . 
well , if there are a lot of alternatives to consider , it &apos;s easy to imagine attractive properties , alternatives that you exclude , which makes you less satisfied with the way alternatives are available that you chose . 
here &apos;s an example of the kind of things you don &apos;t know that are new york , and i apologize . but 
here &apos;s what you think you should have thought . 
here &apos;s a couple of the hamptons . 
very expensive properties . 
beautiful beach , great day . you have it all for yourself . 
what could be better 
, damn ? the man thinks it &apos;s august . everyone in my neighborhood in manhattan is gone . 
i could go straight in front of my house . 
and he spends 2 weeks from the thought pursued the one he had the opportunity to miss day by day a day a great parking lot to have . 
oppertunity costs reduce satisfaction that we have achieved through our selection , even if what we do choose is fantastic . 
and the more opportunities it can choose from , the more attractive properties of this selection will be in the oppertunity costs . 
here &apos;s another example . 
well , this cartoon makes some statements . 
he makes a statement about it in the now living , and perhaps about it , things slowly doing . 
but an important point he makes is that he &apos;s always who you &apos;re looking for a thing to decide on . you &apos;re not going to do other things , and these other things like many attractive properties , and it &apos;s going to be what you &apos;re going to do , making it less attractive . 
thirdly , the escalation of expectations . 
this has hit me when i saw my jeans exchange . 
i wear jeans almost all the time . and 
there was a time when there was only jeans , one kind of jeans , and they got them bought , and they got bad fit , they were incredibly uncomfortable and if they could keep them long enough , and often enough washed them , they did start to get ok , and they started to feel ok . 
so i went to buy new jeans , and after many years of wearing the old and i said , i had liked to have a couple of jeans . here &apos;s my size . 
and the seller said , &quot; do you want to have slender , slightly lying , or wide ? &quot; do 
you want to use buttons or zipper stone or acid washed ? 
do you want to wear jeans with holes ? do 
you want to cut down wide , tapered , blah , blah , blah , and so on ? he told . 
my jaw was down , and after i recovered , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the kind that used to be the only way . 
he had no idea what that was , so i spent a hour doing it all , so all these damn jeans were trying out and drank the business , and i say the truth with the best jeans i ever had . 
i had better to do all this selection , and i was better able to have it . 
but i felt worse . 
why i wrote a whole book to get to try to tell myself , and i &apos;m going to tell you , 
the reason why i was getting worse was that i was having all these available options , my expectations for what kind of good couple of jeans are , went up . 
i had very low expectations , i had no concrete expectations when it came to meeting them only in a way . 
when they were in 100 species , a woman of them would have been perfect . 
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect . 
and so i compared what i got . to what i got , to what i expected , and what i had , was disappointing compared to what i expected . 
adding a range of possibilities to life of people increases inevitably the number of expectations people have . people have a lot to do about how good these opportunities will be . 
and this leads to less satisfaction with the results , even though the results are good . 
nobody in the world of marketing knows this . 
because if you were to , you would not all know what it &apos;s all about . 
the truth is more like this here . 
the reason is that everything is better in the past than anything worse than anything worse than everything worse . was it worse for people to experience the things that a person would have been a pleasant surprise ? 
nowadays , in the world where we live , we &apos;re living , wealthy industrialized citizens with perfection , expecting the best for you ever hope for . is that something that &apos;s so good as you &apos;re doing it from them ? 
they will never be pleasantly surprised because their expectations , my expectations , are high . 
the secret to happiness , that &apos;s what you all came for , the secret to happiness , are low expectations . 
i would like to say a short autobiographical moment that i &apos;ve been married to a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful . 
i would not have done better if i had not been able to settle down . 
but settling down is not always such a bad thing . 
ultimately , a consequence of buying a poorly seated jeans when it &apos;s just a kind of buying there is that there &apos;s that if you &apos;re dissatisfied and you &apos;re wondering why who &apos;s responsible for who &apos;s the answer is clear . the world is responsible , 
what would you have done ? 
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available and you &apos;re buying a one that disappointing is , and you &apos;re asking why , who &apos;s responsible ? is 
it just as clear that the answer to the question is that you they would 
have done better . 
with 100 different types of jeans in the shop window , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes . 
and so when people make decisions and make decisions , and even when the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about it . they accuse themselves . 
clinical depression exploded in industrial world . in the last generation , 
i think a significant , not the only , but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression and also suicide , is that people experience that people who have been disappointing because their standards are so high that they &apos;re so high , and then when they have these experiences to explain themselves , think it would be their fault . 
and so that &apos;s the balance sheet that we generally do better to be objective , and we feel worse . 
so let me just remind you . 
this is the official dogma that has one that we all believe is right , completely wrong , and it &apos;s not true . there is no question of choosing something better . but 
there is no question of choice , but it doesn &apos;t follow . better choice than selecting something . 
there is a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s . 
i am pretty sure that we can do this for a long time , when we have chosen our common good to improve . 
now , as a principle , i &apos;m almost finished as a principle question that matters , about the thinking about the matter , is what all of this selection allows in industrialized societies is that material is wealth . 
there are many places in the world and we have heard about many of them . their problem is not the problem that is too wide a choice . 
your problem is that you have too little . 
so things about the things i &apos;m talking about are a weird problem of the modern rich western societies . 
and what &apos;s so frustrating and annoying is steve levitt has a lot to tell you yesterday that these expensive and hard to fix child seats are not helping . 
that &apos;s a waste of money . 
i &apos;m telling you that these expensive , complicated decisions , it &apos;s not just that they &apos;re not helping . 
they even hurt . 
they ensure that we get worse because we &apos;re worse . 
if some of what people in our society want to make choices in societies were postponed , in societies where people were not sufficiently selective , things didn &apos;t just improve life , people &apos;s lives , but our dignity also improved . economists call this a pareto @-@ improvement application . 
income redistribution will ensure that all of us are better off , not just the poor , because all of this great choice is plaguing us . 
finally , please read this cartoon and a sophisticated person , &quot; ah , what does this fish know ? &quot; 
you know nothing is possible in this goldfish glass . 
impoverished fantasy , a short @-@ sighted view of the world , and that &apos;s the way i read it first . 
the more i think about it , the more i came to the view that the more fish were aware of it . 
because the truth is that if you know the goldfish glass breaking , everything can be done , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis . 
if you like to break the goldfish glass so that everything is possible , lower your satisfaction . 
they increase paralysis and lower the risk of satisfaction . 
everyone needs a goldfish glass . 
this is certainly too limited , perhaps also for the fish , but definitely for us . 
but the lack of a metaphorical goldfish glass is a recipe for misery , and i suspect disaster . 
thank you .
