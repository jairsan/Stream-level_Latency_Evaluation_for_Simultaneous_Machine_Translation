last year , i made these two slides to illustrate that i &apos;ve seen the arctic ice cap that &apos;s going to last for nearly three million years , the size of the bottom 48 states , shrunk by 40 percent . 
but this does not express enough . the seriousness of this particular problem , because it &apos;s not the thickness of the ice . in a sense , 
the arctic ice cap is the beating heart of our global climate system . 
it grows in winter and shrinks in summer . 
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a time lapse shot , which has been going on over the last 25 years . 
the continuous ice is marked with red . 
as you can see , it grows on the dark blue . this is the annual ice in winter . and it shrinks in the summer , 
the so @-@ called &quot; dauereis &quot; , five years old or older , is almost like blood flowing out of the body here . 
in 25 years it will be from here to here gone . 
this is a problem because warming is causing the frozen reason to the arctic ocean to emerge , where there are large amounts of frozen carbon . what if he comes up from microbes to methane , 
compared to the whole amount of methane that changes climate change in the atmosphere , could this amount double ? if we take this critical point over 
, today , in some shallow lakes in alaska , methane is already bubbling out of the water by itself . 
professor katey walter of the university of alaska is also working with another working group on another flat . lake traveled last winter ( 
video ) wow . al gore : you &apos;re doing well . the question is , how will we be ? 
and one reason is this enormous heat storage system is warming greenland from the north . 
this is an annual dew water flow . 
but the volumes are much larger than ever before . 
this is the kangerlussuaq river in southwest greenland . 
if you want to know how sea level rises through land ice melting , here it flows into the sea . 
these rivers are growing rapidly , and 
at the other end of the planet . the antarctic , the largest ice mass on the planet , 
last month , researchers reported that the entire continent is now having a negative ice balance . 
and the west antarctica , which has emerged over a few underwater islands , is particularly strong in melting . 
this corresponds to 20 feet above sea level . 
just as greenland is the third largest ice mass in the himalayas , you see new lakes up there that were glaciers a few years ago . 
40 percent of all people in the world get half of their drinking water . this melting water 
in the andes is the glacier , the drinking water source for this city . 
the amounts of water have increased . 
but if they seal , most of the drinking water will also fall away . 
in california , a 40 % reduction in the snow cover of the sierra was seen . 
this concerns the storage tanks 
and predictions of how they read them , are serious . 
this drying up all over the world leads to a dramatic increase in fires 
and the disasters everywhere on the planet , have . in a truly extraordinary and unprecedented situation , the number of people has increased . 
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 . 
this is a completely untenable pattern of development . 
if you like this in the historical context , you can see what it &apos;s doing . 
in the last 5 years , we &apos;ve been producing 70 million tons of co2 . all 24 hours , 25 million tons a day , into the oceans . 
look at the area of the eastern pacific , from the american continent to the west and on both sides of the indian subcontinent , where there is a drastic decline in oxygen . in the oceans , 
the biggest single factor for global warming is that , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent . burning fossil fuels , 
oil , is a problem . and coal is the biggest problem . 
the united states is one of the two largest polluters , along with china . 
and the proposal was to create many more coal factories . 
but we &apos;re starting to see a change . 
here are the ones that have been deleted in recent years . with some green alternatives proposed , 
but there are a political and political clash in our country , 
and the coal industries and oil industries have a quarter of a billion dollars spent last calendar year to apply clean coal , which in itself is a contradiction in itself . 
this picture reminded me of something to do . 
around christmas , i ran home in tennessee , where i had a billion tons of carbon mud . 
you probably have it in the news . 
this is in our country the second largest waste flow in america . 
this happened around christmas , 
one of the commercials of the coal industry . 
at christmas this frosty was the carbarian , is a happy , happy guy . 
he is in the fullness of his life in america . and he helps our economy grow . 
frosty : the carboniferous man gets cleaner every day . 
it &apos;s affordable and adorable , and workers stay in wages and bread . 
al gore : this is the source of most coal in west virginia . 
the most powerful miner is the leader of massey . coal 
video don blankenship let me just make one thing clear . al gore , nancy pelosi , harry reid you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about . 
al gore : so the alliance for climate protection has launched two campaigns . 
this is part of her 
video , actor . at coalergy , we see climate change as a serious threat to our business . 
that is why we have made it the top line . a considerable amount of money to spend on advertising is needed . to clarify the truth about coal . 
the fact is , coal is not dirty . 
we believe it &apos;s clean and smells of good . 
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change . 
leave it to us ! ( 
video , actor ) saueber kohle you have heard a lot about it . 
so let &apos;s take a tour of these modern , clean coal factories . 
fantastic . this machine is pretty noisy . 
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology . 
and yet , burning coal . one of the main reasons for global warming is the remarkably clean coal technology that you see here changes . 
all of this . look at it exactly . this is the clean coal technology today . 
al gore : finally the positive alternative mixes with our economic challenge and our challenge of the national security . 
video narrator : america is in crisis . the economy , national security , the climate crisis , 
the red thread that connects all of these is . our dependence on carbon @-@ based fuels , such as dirty coal and foreign oil . 
but now there &apos;s a brave new solution to get us out of this miserable situation . 
supply america with 100 percent clean electricity . within the next 10 years , 
a plan to return america to work , to make us safer and to help us to make global warming more stop . 
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems . 
supply america new ! find out more ! 
al gore : this is the last video . 
narrator : it &apos;s about resupplying america , 
one of the fastest ways to reduce our dependence on old dirty fuels that are suffocating our world , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about . 
man : the future is here : wind , sun and a new energy system . 
man no. 2 : new investments to create well @-@ paid jobs 
narrator : supply america new it &apos;s time to accept reality . 
al gore : there &apos;s an old african proverb : &quot; if you want to be fast . &quot; go alone 
if you want to get far , go together . 
we must get far , fast . 
thank you . on the 
last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc . 
and i promised to come back to tell them how the world &apos;s machine works . 
now it &apos;s time for everyone to come and for those who didn &apos;t come back then . the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever to be tackled . 27 kilometers in diameter . 
his task is to understand the conditions that are less than one billionth of a second after the beginning of the universe . and that up to 600 million times within a second . 
it &apos;s just breathtaking , ambitious . 
this is the machine . below geneva : 
we take pictures of these mini big bang in detectors , 
and i &apos;m working on this . he &apos;s called atlas . detector : 44 meters in width 22 meters in diameter here &apos;s a 
spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction so you can see the size . 
on september 10 last year , the machine ran for the first time . 
and this picture was taken by atlas . 
it caused immense cheering in the control room . 
it &apos;s a picture of the first particle of radiation that &apos;s going to cover the entire route around the lhc , then deliberately collided with part of the lhc to get a rain of particles on the detector . 
in other words , when we took this picture on september 10 , we knew that the machine was working , which was a great triumph . 
i don &apos;t know if this is the greatest cheering , or if this is someone who visited the google page . and the home page , so it found 
, means that we have a cultural influence next to the scientific , 
about a week later . was there a problem with the machine that was connected to these wires here ? these golden wires , 
these wires , these wires , are 13 thousand amps . if the machine is running at high performance , 
the engineers , among them , will look at you and say , &quot; no . &quot; you don &apos;t do that . these are small wires . you 
can do that . because if you look very far , you &apos;re going to cool them down to 
so @-@ called superconductors at minus 271 degrees . so colder than the space between the stars , these wires can change the tension . 
in one of the connections between over nine thousand magnets in the lhc , there was a manual defect . 
this makes the wires slightly heated and 13 thousand amps encountered . suddenly , electrical resistance . 
this was the result . 
well , all this is even more impressive . if you imagine that the magnets are over 20 tons , and they &apos;re about 30 tons , they &apos;re shifting . 
so we damaged about 50 percent of the magnets and 
we had to remove them . what we did , 
we conditioned . they repaired them . 
they are all back on their way back . 
towards the end of march , the lhc will be operational again . 
we will turn it on and expect first data in june or july to be collected and we will continue our journey to find out what the building blocks of the universe are . 
well , of course , in a way , these accidents are rekindling . the debate on the value of science and engineering at such borders . it &apos;s easy to reject this . 
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to understand the fact that we &apos;re crossing our borders is the way we value things . like the lhc , 
i will give my final words to an english scientist , humphrey davy , who , as i suspect , when he was the defenders of his apprentice &apos;s useless experiments , was michael faraday . the following said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous . for the development of the human mind to assume that our scientific ideas are final , that there are no mysteries in nature , that our scientific triumphs are full and that our triumphs are not new worlds . 
thank you . 
i want to start by asking you to go back to the time you were a child . thinking back when they played with building blocks while 
they realized how to stretch out and grab hands , pick up the blocks and move , they actually learned to think about and solve problems by understanding and changing spatial connections . 
spatial thinking is close to how the world is doing much of our environment . 
as an informatics scientist inspired by the way we interact with real objects . with my expert advisor patti and my colleague jeevan kalanithi , i started to wonder . what if we were to use computers that were used instead of a mouse @-@ pointer that was like a digital finger tip on a flat worksurface ? what if we were to intervene with both hands and physically physically take 
data and take it so that it could be ordered as we want it to be ? 
this question was so gripping that we were going to explore the answer . and siftables developed , 
in short , a siftable is an interactive computer in the size of a biscuit . 
you can use your hand to move . you can perceive each other . you can capture your movements . and they have a screen and a radio receiver . 
much more important are physical . why do you just use them like blocks of blocks by stretching out your hands and accessing them ? 
and the siftables are an example of a new generation of tools for manipulating digital data . 
and if these aids become more physical and a consciousness of their movements , each other realize each other . and the subtleties of our dealings with them perceive . then we can start exploring new and more entertaining interaction types . 
i &apos;m starting with some simple examples . 
this siftable is designed for video playback . and if i put it in one direction , the video will be played forward . if i put it in the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards . 
and these interactive portraits take each other . 
if i put them side by side , then you &apos;re arousing interest . 
if you are surrounded by one @-@ wire , you notice that , and you can become nervous . 
and they feel their movements and their inclination . 
an interesting consequence of the interactions that we began to recognize was that we had to make everyday gestures on data , such as colors , how to pour them out , how to do it with liquids . 
in this case , we have three siftables configured as color pots . and i can use them to paint in the color in the middle to pour where they &apos;re mixed . 
if we can exaggerate it , we can pour it back a little . 
there are also some nice ways to get into education , such as languages , mathematics , or logic games , where we can give people the chance to try out quickly . and the results want to see immediately . 
here i am . this is a fibonacci episode that i &apos;ve been creating with a simple equation program . 
this is a game with words that have a kind of mixture of scrabble and boggle . 
basically , you get every round on any siftable random assigned letter . and while you &apos;re trying to make words , they &apos;re going to be checked through a dictionary . 
then after about 30 seconds , it &apos;s mixed again . and you have a new combination of letters and new ways to try out . 
thank you . 
these are some children who are on a trip to the media lab . i could get them to try it out , and i got a video of it . 
you really loved it . 
an interesting fact about this type of application is that you can tell people not many instructions . 
all you have to say is , &quot; make words . &quot; and you know exactly what to do . 
here are a few people who have tried it . 
that &apos;s our youngest . beta testers down there right . 
it turned out that he was the siftables just stacking . 
so for him , they were just building blocks . 
this is an interactive animation . 
we wanted to use a language learning tool . 
that &apos;s felix . 
he can create new characters in the scene by playing the siftable from the table , which takes this figure . 
here he lets the sun rise . 
now he &apos;s picking up a tractor in the scene . 
good work . yes , 
by shaking the siftables . and she puts it side by side , he can let the characters interact . his own story 
inventing . it &apos;s a 
story with an open end . and he can decide how they develop . 
the last example i have time to give today is to show it , a music sequencer for live performances that we &apos;ve recently developed . and in the siftables , as sounds like leadership voice , bass and percussion , they act . 
each has four different variations . you can select which one you want to use . 
and you can see these sounds in the sequence that you can put into any pattern , and you can feed 
them into the sequence by going into a sound @-@ siftable , a sequence @-@ siftable . 
there are effects that you can change live , such as hall and filter . 
you connect it to a certain tone and tend to turn it into a setting . 
and then , more generally , effects like tempo and volume that you can see on the whole sequence . 
so let &apos;s look . 
we start in which we have the lead voice fed into two sequence siftable . and these in a row , they sort of sort of add up , and add a little bit more of the voice . 
now i &apos;m adding a bass . 
now i &apos;m going to do some more stuff about it . 
and now i connect the filter to the drums so that i can see the effect live . 
i can &apos;t speed up the whole sequence by moving the pace into one or the other direction . 
and now i connect the filter to the bass for something else . 
i can &apos;t see the sequence as it runs . 
so i don &apos;t have to plan them in advance , but i can improvise , while extending or shortening them . 
and finally , i can hide the whole sequence by reading the volume @-@ siftable to the left . 
thank you . 
so , as you can see , my enthusiasm is to create new human computer interfaces that are better suited to how our brains and bodies work . 
and today i had time to give you some of this new design world . and some of the ways to show what we &apos;re doing in our lab . the idea i 
&apos;ve been thinking of on the way is that the idea we &apos;re going to be on the threshold of this new generation of value witnesses , interacting with digital media . the information in our world brings the requirements that we have . 
thank you . 
i look forward to talking to you all . 
i am a writer . 
writing books is my profession . but of course , it &apos;s more than that . 
it &apos;s also my great lifelong love and fascination . 
and i don &apos;t expect that ever to change . 
but recently , something strange in my life and career has happened , which has led me to think about my relationship to this work completely , 
and i think it &apos;s a very strange thing . this strange event was that i recently wrote a book . a biography called eat pray love this decided differently than all my previous books from some reason in the world , and for a big mega event , international bestseller thing , became . 
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m coming from . 
as if i were doomed to 
fall , seriously doomed to destruction . for example , they are very worried about me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you will never exceed this success ? &quot; don 
&apos;t be afraid that you can do all your life and never go back to a book . someone in the world never cares about it again . okay 
. this really makes you brave . 
it would be worse , however . if i don &apos;t remember that i &apos;m going to be over 20 years ago , when i was a teenager for the first time , when i was telling you that i wanted to be a writer , i was confronted with the same kind of fear @-@ filled reaction . 
people said , &quot; don &apos;t you be afraid ? &quot; never succeed . have you not been 
afraid that humiliation of a rejection will kill you ? 
have you not been afraid that you can make your life go on for this craft and never come up with anything from it , and that you die on a scrap pile of burst dreams ? your mouth filled with bitter ashes of failure . so 
, you know , you know . 
the answer : the short answer to all these questions are indeed . 
yes . i &apos;m afraid of all these things . 
and i always had that . 
and i &apos;ve got a lot more fear of things that nobody would ever suspect of , like algae and other terrifying things . 
but when it comes to writing , i think about it recently , and i wonder . why is that ? it is logical that someone expects 
to be expected to be able to fear it . it 
is logical that someone should be afraid to do the work he feels called to do . 
and what exactly is the creative ? companies based in the netherlands lot that they &apos;re unsure about the state of mind . in a way that other professions don &apos;t do . 
my father , for example , was a chemist . and i can &apos;t remember any situation in his 40 years as a chemist , in which he asked , &quot; whether he &apos;s afraid , chemists , he 
&apos;s got to be . with your chemist blockade john , how are you doing it ? 
it just didn &apos;t happen . but you know , 
to be fair . the group of chemists have been working for centuries not to lose the reputation of alcoholic , manic @-@ depressive . 
we get people , writers seem . but this kind of reputation , but not just the writers , but the creative of all genres , seems to have this reputation . mental monsters to be unstable . 
all you need to do is to get the bitter death figures of really great heads out of the 20th century alone . the young and often by their own hands died . 
and even those who don &apos;t actually begin suicide seemed to be really neglected by their talents . 
norman mailer said shortly before his death in his last interview : each of my books has taken me a little further . 
an extraordinary statement that you have about your life &apos;s work . 
but we &apos;re not even twitching when we &apos;re saying something like this because we &apos;re listening to this kind of statement for so long . somehow we have the idea of how we internalized and collectively accepted that creativity and suffering somehow belong together naturally . and that art always ends up as a torment for souls . 
the question i have to ask everyone here today is this : is this idea completely for you ? 
feel like it , because with just one 
centimeter distance , you look at it . i feel like i &apos;m not at all comfortable with this view . 
i find them horrible . 
and i think it &apos;s dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch them go into the next century . 
i think it &apos;s better . if we want to encourage our great creative people to live , 
and i definitely know that for me , in my situation , it would be very dangerous . to begin this dark path of presumption , so to speak , to leak down , especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career right 
now . that means : see . i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old . 
i may have another 40 years of work in me . 
and it &apos;s very likely that all i &apos;ve got from now on to write is from the world as the work that &apos;s being evaluated after the departure success of my last book , and i &apos;m going to write it . right ? 
i say it straight away . because we &apos;re here . yes . now , everybody , kind of friends . it is highly likely that my greatest success is behind me . 
oh jesus ! what a thought ! 
these are the kinds of thoughts that make someone think about it at 9 a.m. gin gin is going to drink . and i don &apos;t want that . 
i would rather continue to do this work that i love . 
so the question is how to 
get to grips with some time of reflection , and i think i &apos;m going to write a kind of protective psychological construct to keep writing . somehow i have to get a way from now on . when writing a 
safe distance to keep between me and my very natural clutter about how to get the response to the written being 
, while i was in the process of looking for models for this last year to do that , i also have a look at the past . and i tried to get other societies to find out if they could possibly be better or more sensible about it . when we started to help creative people with emotional risks , we started to deal with creativity , 
and we started to do so . this search led me to ancient greece . and ancient rome . 
please follow me . because the circle will close again . 
but in ancient greece and rome , people don &apos;t believe that creativity is the result of people . okay . they 
believed creativity was a kind of divine servant spirit that came from a distant , unknown source to people , from inexplicable , unknown reasons . 
the greeks called these divine servants @-@ spirits of creativity demons of socrates is 
known to be believed in it . he would have a demon who would have given him wisdom from afar . 
the romans had the same idea , they called it . this kind of body @-@ less , creative spirit , a genius . 
that &apos;s great . the romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius , a particularly smart individual . 
they believed that a genius could use this kind of magical divine being . believed that the world was literally in the walls of an artist &apos;s studio . about the same as dobby , the housekeeper , would come out and help the artist to work in a way invisible . and the result of the work would be to design . 
that &apos;s brilliant . there &apos;s it . there &apos;s the distance i talked about . the psychological construct that you have seen from the consequences of your work . 
and everyone knew that it worked like this . right ? 
the artist of antiquity was above all protected , as for example , too much narcissism , right ? 
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at everything for you . book now . everyone knew you could see this body @-@ less genius that helped you . 
if your work didn &apos;t completely flap your mistake , or 
everyone knew your genius was a bit lame . 
so people in the west have really been talking about creativity for a long time . 
and then the renaissance came . and everything changed . we had this big idea . and this big idea was , let &apos;s let the human individual go to the center of the universe , to all the gods and mysteries . and there &apos;s no room for mystical creatures anymore . the commands of the divine accept . 
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism . and people started to believe that creativity is completely different from their own individual . 
for the first time in history , people hear this or that artist . a genius call it instead of being a genius . 
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake . 
you know , i think to be allowing a mere person to think he or she &apos;s like that vessel , like that basin , and the essence , and the source , of all the divine , creative , unknown , infinite . mystery is a little bit too much responsibility to give it to a fragile human psyche . 
it &apos;s like asking someone to see the sun swallow . 
this distorts and distorts whole ego &apos;s . and it creates all these unattainable expectations of success . 
i think that this pressure to succeed , our artists , has destroyed the last 500 years . 
and if that &apos;s true . and i think it &apos;s true , is the question . 
can we change it ? 
maybe to an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of creative return . 
maybe not . 
maybe we can get the idea from 500 years of rational humanism not just in an 18 @-@ minute talk . 
and there are certainly people in this audience who really have legitimate scientific doubts about how to get the idea of basically fairies , people follow people , and fairy @-@ birds on their projects , etc . 
i &apos;m probably not going to see all of you take this trip . 
but the question i want to raise is , why ? not . 
why not think about it ? 
because it &apos;s just as much sense as anything else i &apos;ve heard of . when it comes to the absolutely crazy whim @-@ heartedness of the creative process . 
a process that , as everyone knows , ever tries to do something about it . so in other words , everyone here , not always sensible . 
in fact , he can sometimes almost paranormal feel . 
i recently had such an encounter . when i saw the extraordinary american poet ruth stone , who now has over 90 , but who is her whole life as a poet . she told me that when she was in virginia , she grew up outside in the fields . she said she would feel and hear how a poem about the world &apos;s landscape was . it would come to pass . 
she said it was like a thundering train out of air that 
was going to take you across the country . 
she felt when it came , because it would make the earth under her feet quake . 
she knew she was in such a moment only doing one thing . and that was in their words , &quot; race like the devil . &quot; 
she ran like the devil to the house while she was inspired by this poem . it was only about them being quick enough to make a sheet of paper and a pen . so that they could get it through them when it thunder , catch it and get it stuck on the sheet . 
in other paintings , she was not fast enough . she ran and ran and ran . but she reached the house . and the poem rolled through them . and she missed it . she said it would continue to move over land . and as she said , after another poet , look for something . 
and then there were these moments , and i &apos;ll never forget that part . she said that there were moments when she was almost missing it . 
so she runs to the house and looks for the paper . and the poem goes through them . and she takes a pen . just when it goes through it . and then she said , &quot; it was like you were going to go with your other hand and grab it . 
get it back . the poem on his tail and pulled it back into her body and took it over to the leaf of paper . 
on these occasions , the poem came flawlessly and intact on paper . but backwards from the last word . for the first time 
, when i heard that , i thought , &quot; this is scary . that &apos;s just like my creative process . 
that &apos;s not like my creative process at all . i am not the channel . 
i &apos;m a mule to be able to work , i have to work every day at the same time , and sweat , i have to work hard and really torment unpleasant . 
but even i , in my mule species , sometimes striped this thing . 
and i guess many of you think that &apos;s 
what they did . even i had work or ideas that came from a source through me , which i really didn &apos;t identify . 
what is this thing ? 
and how do we relate to this without having to understand our mind , but rather to us ? even in mental health . 
for me , the best thing is : living example of how to do this . the musician tom waits i was allowed to thank him a few years ago for a magazine . 
we talked about this topic . and you know what ? most of his life was tom , the embodiment of tormented modern artist , who tried to ... these uncontrollable creative impulses that lived in him to master and to communicate with them . 
but then he got older and quieter . he told me that one day he was on a highway in los angeles . and then everything changed for him . 
he went at high speed when he suddenly saw a small fragment . a melody that sounds like inspirations . it &apos;s often for him tormenting . it is hard to grasp . and he will have them . it &apos;s magnificent . he then leaks . but he can &apos;t hold it . 
he has no piece of paper . he has no pen . he has no cassette recorder . 
so it starts this old anxiety in it , like the old one , &quot; i &apos;m going to rise . this thing will lose and be lost by this song forever . 
i &apos;m not good enough . i don &apos;t manage . but 
instead of panic , he heard it just stop . 
he finished the whole course of thought and did something completely new . 
he just looked into the sky and said , &quot; excuse me , can &apos;t you see i &apos;m driving a car ? &quot; 
i look like this . as if i were writing a song . 
if you really want to exist , come to a more favorable moment . if i &apos;m looking after you 
, if i &apos;m not tormented by 
tortures , if someone else goes 
and torment leonard cohen . all the work process has changed . 
not the work itself . it was often so dark as it was ever before . 
but the process and the heavy grief that surrounds him was lifted . when he got the genius out of himself , where he had nothing but trouble , and he left him back where he came from , so to speak . he realized that there was no internally tormenting thing . 
it could be a strange , miraculous , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the stranger . external thing that &apos;s not . tom was very happy 
when i heard this story , and it changed a little bit . the way i worked , and it made me feel saved . this idea 
saved me . when i was in the middle of the writing process of eat pray love , i fell into one of these ducts of doubt that we all fall into . if we work on something and we don &apos;t work , you catch thinking that it &apos;s a disaster . this will be the worst book ever written . 
not only bad , but the worst of all times . 
i started thinking . i should simply stamp the project . 
but then i remembered how tom was in the free sky . and i tried it . 
so i lifted my gaze from the manuscript and i said my comment towards an empty corner of space . 
i said loud , &quot; hear , you thing , you and i know both of them . if this book is not brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my fault . right ? 
because you see that i &apos;m doing everything i have . i have no more than that . 
if you do have better , you have to cross up here and increase your share of the deal . okay . 
but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what the hell is doing with it . 
i will continue to write . because this is my job . 
and i would ask you to record that i am voting for my part today in favour of the job here . 
because in the end , it &apos;s as follows : centuries ago , in the deserts of north africa , people turned to moonlight festivals with sacred dances and music . held for hours , until dawn . 
these festivals were always great , because the dancers were professional . and they were fantastic . 
but now and then , very rarely , something special happened . one of the actors was actually superworldly . 
and i know you know what i mean . because i know that they all live in their lives once a day , they &apos;ve seen such a performance . 
it was as if the time was standing still and the dancer was passing through a kind of gate . he did nothing but to ever do it before . 1,000 nights ago but everything went together . 
and suddenly he didn &apos;t appear anymore pure , human . 
he was illuminated from within and from below . and everything was illuminated by a divine fire , 
as such . at that time , people knew what that was . they called it by its name . 
they laid hands together and started to sing . allah allah allah god god god - that is god . do 
you know interesting 
historical footnote when the ethiopian southern spain ? they conquered , brought this custom with them , the debate changed . over the centuries , from allah , allah to olé olé olé , which is still to be seen in bullfights and flamenco dances . 
if a performer in spain is doing something impossible , something magical . allah olé olé allah great bravo incredible . there &apos;s it . a fleeting look at god 
and that &apos;s great . because we need that . 
but the tricky part follows the next morning . if the dancer wakes up and realizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday , and he &apos;s no longer a little bit of god in himself . 
he &apos;s just an aging mortal with painful knees . and maybe he will never again go to these heights . 
and maybe never again will anyone know god &apos;s name . if he turns , but what should he do with the rest of his life ? 
that &apos;s hard . 
this is one of the most painful corrections to a creative life . 
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of pain . if you are not believed from the beginning that the most extraordinary aspects of your life are coming from you . 
if you might just believe that you have a loan from a tremendous source for a very fine time of your life , which is connected to someone else . when you &apos;re done with it 
, when we start thinking about it , change . all 
this . so i started thinking . and so i think i &apos;m sure . in recent months , while i have been working on the book that will soon appear as the dangerous , scary , greatly awaited . successor of my successful race , 
which i constantly have to say to myself . if i get crazy about it , i &apos;ve got don &apos;t be afraid , 
don &apos;t be discouraged . just do your job remains 
for your contribution . whatever he is . 
may your job be dancing , dance , 
if the stupid divine genius that you have to face is the one you have . decides for a short moment a touch of wonder through your effort to show . then olé 
and if not , dance your dance and olé 
for you . despite all this , i 
believe . and i feel we should do this . 
olé , for you . despite all this , just for you to be able to understand the mere human love and attachment to it . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
june cohen olé 
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome . and what that might mean , and about the discovery of new groups of genes . 
in fact , we start from a new point . we &apos;ve digitized biology . and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code to a new phase of biology . by living new life and building new life . 
we have always tried to ask important questions . 
what is life ? it &apos;s something that &apos;s happening . i believe that many biologists have tried to understand and do this on different levels . 
we have tried different approaches to make it possible to use it to 
simplify the minimum components . we have spent nearly 20 years digitizing . when we sequenced the human genome , the change from the human analogue world to biology was happening to the digital world . the computer , 
now we &apos;re trying to ask if we can regenerate life , or if we can create new life . this digital universe . 
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma geitalium , which is the smallest genome of a species that has itself replicated in the lab . and we tried to see if we could do this with an even smaller genome . 
we managed to do it . at about one hundred genes to refrain from the 500 or so . these are : but 
if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to our trust , you know , me . that &apos;s simple . but if we all look at these genes that we have one after the other to eliminate , it &apos;s very unlikely that this will lead to a living cell , and that &apos;s not the case . 
so we decided that it would be the only way forward . this chromosome actually synthesize what allows us to make the individual components vary , and so we can sort of ask some of these fundamental questions . 
and so we started to talk to the question , &quot; can we synthesize a chromosome ? 
&quot; and so it allows chemistry to actually create these really big molecules , which has never been done before . 
and if we can , we can do that , we can start the chromosome . 
a chromosome is just one piece of inert chemical material by 
the way . our steps in digitising life were very exponential , 
our ability to use genetic code has been changed very slowly , and it has nevertheless increased . and our last point would now be an exponential curve . 
we started 15 years ago . 
it actually took a few years , starting with a bioethical review . before we start the first experiments , 
it turned out , dna synthesization is very difficult . 
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that are small pieces of dna . 30 to 50 letters long but it &apos;s a degenerative process . so the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes happen . 
so we had to develop a new method that we could use to compose these little pieces and correct the mistakes . 
that was our first attempt , starting with digital information about the genome phi . x 174 
it &apos;s a small virus . the bacteria kill . 
we created small pieces , made a bug correction , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters . 
the exciting phase came when we saw this piece of inert chemistry and we went into a bacterium , and the bacterium started to use genetic code to read and make viral particles . 
the viral particles were then removed from the cells and returned to the hospital and killed e. coli . 
recently , i started talking to the oil industry . and they said they were going to understand this model . 
they laughed more than they were . so we think that this is a situation . in the software , actually build your own hardware , can be in a biological system . 
but we wanted to go a lot further . we wanted to have a whole bacterial chromosome built . it has more than 580,000 letters of genetic code . so we thought . we build it in cassettes . from the size of the virus , which means the size . the cassettes could vary to understand what the individual components of a living cell are . 
design is the key . and if you &apos;re using digital information in the computer , you have to really do this digital information to be flawless . 
when we first saw the genome sequencing in 1995 , the error rate was one error per 10,000 base pairs . 
we found 30 errors in resequencing . if we look at the original sequence , it would never have been possible . going up , 
part of the design is to create pieces . the 50 letters are long and the ones with other 50 letters have to overlap pieces to create smaller sub @-@ units so that they fit together . 
we have unique elements built in here . 
you may have heard that we built watermarks . 
think about it . we have a 4 @-@ letter code a , c , g and t 
triplets . this letter , these letters , encode about 20 amino acids . and here &apos;s a single provision . for each of these amino acids , 
we can use the genetic code to translate our words . sentences &amp; thoughts at 
first we only signed . 
some people were disappointed that there was no poetry . 
we have the pieces constructed in such a way that we can simply break them down with enzymes . there are enzymes that repair and restore these . 
and we started to create pieces , starting with pieces that were five to seven thousand letters , and we added . these are 24 000 @-@ letter pieces to make them rejoin , up to 72 000 . 
in every step , we have these pieces produced in surplus so that we could sequence them . because we tried to create a very robust process , which you could do in a minute . 
we tried to get to the point of automation . 
so that looks like a basketball playoff . 
if we are to get to these really big pieces , with over 100,000 base pairs . then these are not simply written in e. coli . it exceeds all the possibilities of modern molecular biology . and so we turned to other mechanisms . 
we knew about a mechanism that is called homologous recombination , which biology uses to make dna , repair dna that can fix these pieces together . 
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s an organism called deinococcus radiodurans , which has three million wheel of radiation . 
you can see in the upper field that his chromosome just falls apart . 
12 to 24 hours later , everything has changed so much as it was . 
we have thousands of organisms that can do that . 
these organisms can be totally dried up . you can even live in vacuum . 
i am absolutely sure that space life exists and that it moves . looking for aquatic conditions ? actually , nasa has 
shown that the nasa has seen a lot of it out there . 
here &apos;s a picture of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by making this process use of , and we &apos;ve got it . in fact , we &apos;ve only used yeast mechanisms with the right design . the pieces we have fit them in . yeast then automatically adds them together . 
that &apos;s not an electron microscope . it &apos;s a regular microscope image . 
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we even use it with the light microscope . 
these are recordings for a duration of 6 seconds . 
this is the publication that we have just completed recently . 
these are over 580,000 letters of genetic code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with a defined structure that ever happens to be created by humans . it has a molecular 
weight of over 300 million . 
if we are dealing with a font size of 10 and without spacing , it would be . it has 142 pages . just to use this genetic code . 
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ? 
obviously , it &apos;s a virus that &apos;s very simple . it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria . 
it &apos;s also easier . if you look at it in eukaryonts , as we are , you just take out the nucleus and give it another one . and that &apos;s exactly what they all know about cloning . 
in archaebacteria , the chromosome is transferred to the cell . but recently , we &apos;ve shown that you can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from a cell to another , and you can do it . and this can activate 
we cleaned . the chromosome of a microbial species , roughly speaking , are these two , as far as they are distant from each other as humans and mice . we gave some extra genes to help us select this chromosome . we were decomposing it with enzymes to treat all proteins . and it was very amazing when we saw it in a cell . and they &apos;re going to be our very mature graphics . here 
the new chromosome went into the cell . 
in fact , we thought that this is the end . but we tried to make the process a little bit further . 
this is the main mechanism . evolution here . 
we find all kinds of species . here &apos;s a second chromosome that &apos;s taken up , or a third one from somewhere . every time thousands of characteristics in just one second turn into a species adding people . 
so evolution is imagining itself as a gene that leads to a change at a time , and a lot of biology has missed . 
there are enzymes called restrictive enzymes that actually actually digest dna . 
the chromosome that is in the cell has none of the chromosomes that we inserted . already . 
it was found in the cell and it recognized the other chromosome as a foreign material . digested it . and so we had only one thing in the end , with a new chromosome . 
it turned blue because of the genes we inserted . 
and after a very short time , it had all the characteristics of the species lost and completely converted into a new species . based on the new software that we have been given into the cell . 
all proteins changed , the membranes changed as we saw the genetic code , and we changed . was it exactly what we transferred ? it 
may be like genomic alchemy . but we can do this by moving software dna , by changing things quite dramatically . 
now i &apos;ve argued that this is not genesis . this is based on 3.5 billion years . evolution 
and i &apos;ve argued that we might be doing this , a new form of cambrian explosion , in which it &apos;s going to create massive new species formation based on this digital design . 
why should we do that ? 
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious . with regard to what we need . 
we are in the process of getting six and a half to nine billion people . in the next 40 years , 
to grow it in my context , i was born in 1946 . 
today , three people on this planet are for everyone who lives in 1946 . within 40 years , four will be . 
we have problems with food , fresh and clean water . medicine fuel for 6 5 billion people . 
it will be a challenge to offer that for 9 . 
we need more than five billion tons of coal . 30 @-@ plus billion barrels of oil these are a hundred million . barrels a day if 
we talk about biological processes or any process to do that , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge . 
then of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material that &apos;s landing in the atmosphere . 
we have now come from our discoveries from all over the world to create a database of about 20 million genes . and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future . 
the electronics industry had a dozen components . and look at the diversity . the result is that 
we are first and foremost attacking the borders of biological reality . and to those of our ideas , 
we have technologies today . because of these fast synthesis methods to do what we can do , what we call combinatorial genetics . 
we now have the opportunity to create a big robot that can take millions of chromosomes a day , and we can do this . 
if you imagine these 20 million different genes being produced , or these processes being optimized to be octane , or drugs being made new vaccines . we can only work with a small team to change molecular biology . when the last 20 years of science , 
and it &apos;s just male selection . we can select &quot; viability &quot; , &quot; production of chemicals &quot; or &quot; fuel production &quot; , &quot; vaccine production &quot; and so on . 
this is a recording of real design software , where we work , with which you actually sit down and new species on the computer . kenn : 
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like . we know exactly how their genetic code will look . 
we are now focusing on fuels from the fourth generation . 
you recently have maize to ethanol . what just ? a bad experiment is , 
we have fuels . the second and third generation , which are coming out relatively soon , will have much higher sugar @-@ making activities , like octane or different kinds of butanol . 
but as we think , the only way that biology can have a big impact without further increasing costs on food or food , or limiting costs to availability , is to have a co2 @-@ based base when we see co2 . and so we &apos;re working on cells that go that way . 
and we think we &apos;re going to start with the fourth generation of fuels . and that &apos;s about 18 months of 
sunlight and co2 , and that &apos;s a method . 
but in our discovery of the world , we &apos;ve all found different methods . 
this is an organism that we described in 1996 . 
he lives in the deep sea about one and a half miles deep at almost boiling water temperatures . 
it converts co2 into methane , under the use of hydrogen as an energy source . 
we investigate whether we use stored co2 , which is easy to produce places , and we &apos;re going to study . convert co2 to fuel to make this process happen . 
within a short period of time , we believe . we could be able to . one of the fundamental questions of life to solve 
. you know , we really have moderate targets , like replacing the entire petrochemical industry . and that &apos;s exactly when you don &apos;t do that at ted , where else is a major source of energy . 
but we &apos;re just working on it right now . the same approaches to the development of vaccines . 
you &apos;ve got it this year with flu . we are always one year behind and have a dollar to pay too little if it comes to the right vaccine . 
i think this will be changed by changing recombinant vaccines in the forefront , and i think that can be changed . 
that &apos;s how the future might look like . changes can now be used to accelerate the evolutionary tree , with synthetic bacteria , archaea , and possibly eukaryotes . 
we &apos;re light years away from improving people . our goal is to only be able to have a chance to have a long enough survival to possibly do that . thank you . 
what i &apos;m going to tell you first as quickly as possible is the basic work , a new technology that we call microsoft part of a takeover , just a year ago , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do . 
this is seadragon . and it &apos;s an environment where you can either be local or away with huge amounts of visual data , and you can do it . 
we see many , many gigabytes of digital photos here that you can seamlessly and continuously get up to , swivel in any way you can rearrange . 
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we look at , how big these collections are , or how big the images are . 
most of them are digital photos of a camera . but this one is , for example , a scan from the congress library . and it &apos;s in an area of 300 megapixels . 
it makes no difference . because the only thing that can be done about limiting the performance of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen . at every moment . 
it also has a very flexible architecture . 
this is a whole book . an example of non @-@ image data . 
that &apos;s bleak house of dickens . each column is a chapter 
to prove that it &apos;s really a matter of a text and not a text , not an image . can we do something like that to really show that these are one real representation of the text and not an image ? 
maybe this is an artificial way of writing an e @-@ book . 
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it . 
this is a more realistic case . this is an issue of the guardian . 
every big picture is the beginning of a section . 
and that really gives you the pleasure . and the good experience . a real paper edition of a magazine or a newspaper to read what is itself a kind of medium with several orders of magnitude . 
we also have something on the corner of this special edition of the guardian . 
we have a false message with very high resolution , which has been much higher than in a normal ad . and we have added additional content . 
if you want to see the features of this car , you can see them here , 
or other models . or even technical specifications . 
and this really does take up these ideas , these restrictions on the space available on the screen . 
we hope that this will not be pop @-@ ups and other nonsense anymore . that should not be necessary . 
of course , mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this . 
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here . except to say that we have also been contributing to this area . 
but these are all the streets in the u.s.a. 
, all of them in the upper picture 
of the nasa . let us now have something else out of it . 
that &apos;s even live on the internet . you can check it out . 
this is a project called photosynth , which really has two different technologies in common . 
one is seadragon and the other is a very good research . about computervision , which is done by noah snavely , a university student at washington university , under steve snavely &apos;s advice to uw . 
and rick szeliski from microsoft research was conducted a very good collaboration . 
so this is live on the internet . it is powered by seadragon . 
you can see that . if we take these kinds of views that we can create through images , we can penetrate them . and this experience of the multiple resolution . 
but the spatial arrangement of the images is here . in fact , 
of importance , computer vision algorithms have captured these images together so that they can give the real space in which these recordings , all near the grassi , lakes , in the canadian rockies , were made . you see elements of stabilized slides or panoramic image processing here . and these things were all spatially related to each other . 
i don &apos;t know if i still have time to give you other environments . 
there are those who are much more spatial . 
i would like to make a straight one of the original records of noah . and that &apos;s from an early prototype of photosynth , where we first saw this work in the summer to give you that to show you what i think it really is the point behind this technology , the photosynth technology . and this is not necessarily so obvious . if you look at the environments that we &apos;re having on the website , 
we had to look at lawyers , etc . 
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral . notre dame , who is only in computer with pictures of flickr . if 
you just gave notre dame in flickr . and they &apos;re going to take pictures of men in t @-@ shirts and on the university grounds , etc . 
each of these orange cones represents an image that is seen as belonging to this model . 
so all of this is flickr images . and they all stand up spatially , in this way , in relation to each other . and 
we can look at this very simple way . 
you know , i never believed i would end up working at microsoft . 
i am very grateful for the welcome here . 
i guess you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras . everything is about it from the mobile phone camera to professional . slrs : a pretty big one . number of them all in this environment , which were flicked together . and 
if possible , i &apos;ll get some of the strange things . many of them are covered with faces , etc . , 
somewhere . here are a number of photographs . here are you : 
this is actually a poster of notre dame . the right record was recorded . 
we can get from the poster to a physical view of this environment . 
the point here is that we &apos;re doing things with the social environment . 
now , data from all are collected , from the entire collective memory , from how visually earth looks . and everything is connected . all these photos are connected 
to each other . and there &apos;s something happening . that &apos;s bigger than the sum of the parts . 
you will receive a model that will be created from all over the world . 
look at this as the continuation of the work of stephen lawler on virtual earth . 
and that &apos;s something that &apos;s caused by complexity that people use to do it , grows , and its benefits for the user with the application . the growing number of 
photos you take will be increasing . signposted with metadata that a different person has entered . 
if someone takes the trouble and has done all these sacred things , and tells who is going to be . then my photo of notre dame cathedral suddenly gets taken with all these data . and i can see it as a starting point to move into this room , dive into this metaverse , take photos of other people , and so i can use a kind of cross @-@ modal social experience with the use of other providers . 
and of course by @-@ product , all of this is the immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the world that are not only superfluous or satellite images , and so on , but also collective memory . 
thank you . 
chris anderson : i understand you . right ? your software allows you to run a specific time within the next few years all the images that someone has in the world shared with you . in principle 
, baa will be linked together . yes . it does nothing but discover . if you want , it creates hyperlinks between the images . 
and she does this because of the content in the pictures . 
and that &apos;s really exciting . if you want to remember the abundance of semantic information that many of these images have . 
how if you want to search for images where you type sentences and the text of the website contains many information about how to create the image ? but how about the 
picture ? you know , with all your pictures ? then 
the scope of the semantic cross @-@ connection and the abundance that arises from it is really enormous . 
it &apos;s a classic network effect . 
ca blaise that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations . baa have 
you got it ? thank you . do you know one of the big neglect when traveling ? and one of the joys in ethnographic research is , together with people , to live together who are still interested in the old days . those who remember their past are still in the wind , they are on the rains , they are smoothing stones . touch the bitter leaves . the plants taste simple . 
the knowledge that jaguar shamans are still beyond the milky way , or the meaning of myths of the elders of inuit is still of great importance , or that in the himalayas the buddhists still breathe their breath of dharma . does the central revelation of anthropology mean that it is remembered ? this is the idea that the world in which we live is not in absolute sense , it is only in absolute sense , but as a model of reality . 
as a result of a group of certain possibilities of adaptation that our ancestors , although successful many generations ago , chose . 
and of course , we all share the same adaptive needs . 
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world . 
we go through initiation rituals . 
we must deal with the unstoppable separation by death . and so it should not surprise us that we all sing , dance . and to bring forth art . 
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique tone of the song , the rhythm of the dance . in every culture , 
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s a matter of the penan in the forests of borneo , or whether it &apos;s a matter of the penan . or the voodoo acolyths in haiti . or the warriors in the kaisut desert of northern kenya . the curanderos in the andes or a caravan factory in the middle of the sahara . this is by chance the colleague i was talking to a month ago in the desert , or even a yak shepherd who was on the slopes of qomolangma everest 
, the godmother of the world . 
all these people teach us that there are other ways of existence , other ways of thinking , other ways of orientating ourselves on earth . 
and that &apos;s an idea that , if you think about it , you can only fill it with hope . 
together , the countless cultures of the world form a network of spiritual and cultural life that will encircle the earth . and for the good of the earth , it &apos;s just as important as the biological network of life that you know as a biosphere . 
you can imagine this cultural network of life as an ethnosphere . ethnosphere can be considered the total sum of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations and intuitions that are of human imagination . since the beginning of consciousness , the definition has been defined . 
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity . 
it is the symbol of all that we are . and what we know as amazing , eager species . 
and just like the biosphere was drained off a lot , this happened to the ethnosphere , only at even greater speed . 
no biologist would dare to claim , for example , that 50 % or more of all species are just before extinction , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet this is the most apocalyptic scenario in the field of biodiversity , which is hardly in line with what we see as the most optimistic scenario in the field of cultural diversity . 
and the crucial indicator is extinction , the extinction of languages . 
when each of them in this room was born , the first of them was 6000 languages on earth . 
now , a language is not just the whole of vocabulary , or a set of grammar rules . 
one language is an expression of the human mind . 
it is a means of bringing the soul of a particular culture into the material world , and it is a means of giving it access to the material world . 
every language is like an old forest of spirit . a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities . 
and of these 6000 languages , today , while we &apos;re here in monterey , half of them are no longer going to be in the ears of children . 
they &apos;re no longer taught to infants . that means that if nothing is done , they are actually dead . 
what could be more lonely than enveloped by silence ? one of the last of your people to be speaking your language . no way to have it . the wisdom of the ancestors to pass on , or the hope of expecting children . 
and yet this terrible fate actually happens to someone somewhere on earth . ca : all two weeks , because every two weeks , an older person dies and takes the last syllables of an old language with him into the grave . 
and i know that some of you say , &quot; is it not better ? &quot; so the world would not be a better place . if we all have one language , and i say , &quot; well , let this language be yoruba . &quot; let them be cantonese . 
let them be kogi . 
and then they would suddenly realize . how it would be if you could not speak your own language ? 
so i want to put you on a journey through the ethnosphere today . a short journey through the ethnosphere to try to make you understand . what actually lost is that it &apos;s been . 
now there are some of us who are , in a sense , forgotten that when i say , different ways of being , really different ways of being . my 
take them for example , this child , the barasana , in the northwest of the amazon , the anaklona people , believe that they mythologically believe that they &apos;re going to see the flow of milk from the east in the belly of holy snakes . 
this is a people who don &apos;t cognitively distinguish between the colors blue and green . since the tent of heaven is to the forest , from which men depend . 
you have a strange language . and a marriage rule called linguistic exogamy . you have to marry someone who has a different language . 
all of this is rooted in the mythological past , the peculiarity of these great houses , where , due to mixed marriages , six or seven languages are spoken , is that you never hear someone who speaks a language . 
you just listen and start to hear and talk . 
or one of the most fascinating tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the waorani , in the northeast of ecuador . an amazing people who first came to peace in 1958 . 
in 1957 , five missionaries tried to get in touch and made a serious mistake . 
they threw shiny photos of themselves from the air . what we call a friendly gesture would be , and you forgot that these people were coming from the rainforest in their lives never before seen anything two @-@ dimensional . 
they took these photographs from the forest floor , tried to get behind the face or figure , found nothing , and concluded that this was business cards of the devil and killed the five missionaries with the spear . 
but the waorani not only killed outsiders with the spear . 
they pierced each other , 
54 % of deaths happened through holes . 
we followed geneaology for eight generations back and found two cases of a natural death . and when we saw people doing something about it , they gave them that one of the people was so old that one of the people was so old that he died because of his age . and we killed him anyway with the spear . but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest . the amazing thing was , 
their hunters could see the urine of an animal 40 steps away and determine which species of animal it belonged to , 
in the early 80s , i got a really amazing job when i was . my professor at harvard asked if i was interested in going to haiti . and the question of secret societies infiltrating into the secret societies that are the foundation of duvalier &apos;s strength . and tonton macoutes were . and the poison that was used to kill zombies . 
to make sure that this sensation makes sense , i had to know something about this remarkable belief of vodoun . and voodoo is not a cult of black . magic - 
on the contrary . it is a complex metaphysical worldview , 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if i asked you , the big world religions would list . what would you say ? 
christianity in the united states islam buddhism / judaism or whatever . 
a continent is always omitted . because the presumption was that in black africa there was no religious belief . of course , there was one , and voodoo is simple . the remnant of this very profound religious thought that was found during the tragic diaspora of the slavery era . 
but what voodoo makes so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead . 
the living bear the spirits . 
the spirits can be heard from under the great water . answers to the rhythm of dance to the soul of the living temporarily pass away . so that the acolyth is for a short , shining moment to god . 
deshab : do the voodooists like to say ? you white people go to church and talk about god . 
we dance in the temple and become god . 
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to be taken by the spirit . how can you be hurt ? 
see these amazing demonstrations of voodoo @-@ acolytes in a trance state , the glowing coal without burning . an amazing illustration of the capacity of the mind to influence the body in such a way that it can endure it when it enters into a state of extreme arousal . 
now , of all the people i &apos;ve met , the kogi were from sierra nevada , santa marta , in northern colombia , the most extraordinary 
descendants of ancient tyrannical civilization that the caribbean coastal plain of colombia populated . and as a result of the conquest , this people moved into an isolated volcanic massif . the above the caribbean coast . 
in a bloodstained continent , these people were . the only ones that never conquered by the spaniards until today , 
to this day , they are being conquered by a ritual priesthood , training as a priesthood , but it &apos;s very extraordinary . 
the young acolyths are born at the age of three and four by their families . and in a shadowy world of darkness , in stone huts , at the foot of the glaciers , for 18 years , shut down . two periods of nine years , deliberately chosen to take the nine months of pregnancy , which they had in their womb , their mother &apos;s womb . now , spend metamorphically in the lap of the great mother . 
and during all this time , they &apos;re going to culturally be incorporated into the values of their society . values that maintain the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic or we could say that the ecological balance is maintained . 
at the end of this amazing initiation , you &apos;ll one day . suddenly taken out . and for the first time in your life , at the age of 18 . see a sunrise . and in this crystal clear moment of consciousness , the first light , when the sun begins to rise on the slopes of the amazingly beautiful landscape . suddenly , everything you see in abstract is going to be learned . in astonishing splendour , confirmed and the priest resigns 
and says , &quot; look , you see , it &apos;s really like i told you . 
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . 
they call themselves the older brothers and say that we , who are the younger brothers , are for the destruction of the world responsible . 
well , this level of intuition is very important . 
whenever we think about natives and landscapes , we either invoke rousseau and the old rumour of the noble wild , upward , which in its simplification . a racist thought is , or is thoreau , saying , &quot; these people are more connected to nature . &quot; so when we &apos;re natives 
, we &apos;re neither sentimental . they are still being weakened by nostalgia . 
it doesn &apos;t have much space for it . in malaria @-@ contaminated swamps of asmat or the cold winds of tibet . but they have , however , been able to create a mysterious nimbus of the earth through time and ritual , which is not based on the idea of being consciously close to it , but on a far more subtle intuition of the idea that the earth itself can exist only because it is inhaled into the human consciousness . 
now , what does that mean ? 
it means that a little child from the andes who lives in faith is growing up , that the mountain is an apu spirit that is his or her destiny , a whole different person will be . and another relationship with this resource , or this place , has been a little kid from montana who lived in the faith , that a child &apos;s mountain , a pile of stones , is . the wearer can be removed 
whether he is a abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant . 
the interesting thing is the metaphor that makes the relationship between the individual and nature defined . 
i grew up in the forests of british columbia and believed that these forests would be there . they were being rounded . 
that made me another person . when my friends were among the kwakiutl who believe that these forests are the whereabouts of hukuk and the curved beak of heaven and cannibal spirits , the most northern end of the world , spirits that they live on their hamatsa initiation would participate . 
now , when you start to look at the idea that these cultures create different realities , you can create some of their extraordinary discoveries . for example , this plant here . 
it &apos;s a photo that i took last april in the northwest of the amazon . 
this is ayahuasca , of which many of you have heard , the strongest psychoactive drug from the repertoire of the shaman . 
what makes ayahuasca so fascinating is not only the pharmacological potential . this preparation , but its processing . it &apos;s really made up of two different sources . on the one hand , there are these wooden lianas that have a number of beta @-@ carbolines ( harmine , harmolin , hallucinogen ) . this climbing plant alone is about as if it were a blue turmoil of smoke on it &apos;s consciousness . but it &apos;s going to be covered with the leaves of a bouquet of the family of coffee plants 
called . psychotria viridis mixed 
this plant contains some very strong tryptamins that are similar to serotonin , dimethyltryptamin @-@ 5 and methoxydimethyltryptamine . 
if you have ever seen the yanomami , how you can do this stuff . this substance that you can make from different kinds also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine , 
this powder to snuff is about the same as from a gun run shot at . lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity , there will be no distortion of reality , but the dissolution of reality . 
i even started with my professor richard . evan shultes the man who has the psychedelic erea with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico . in the 1930s , the debate has begun . i claimed that you don &apos;t see these tryptamins as hallucinogen . since at the moment you have the impact , you don &apos;t feel it anymore , there &apos;s a hallucination to experience . but the thing about tryptamins is that they don &apos;t take orally . 
because they &apos;re not taken orally by a human gut . of course , occurring enzyme named monoamine oxidase will be denaturated . 
you can only use some other devices in conjunction with oral treatment , which the mao denaturate . 
now , the fascinating thing is that the beta @-@ carbolins that are contained in the liane , the mao inhibitors , are of exactly the kind that &apos;s necessary to potenate the tryptamins . ask yourself , then . 
how can these people come from a flora of 80,000 species of astringent plants ? these two morphologically unrelated plants find the most common plants that , when combined in this way , are creating a kind of biochemical version , so that the whole thing is larger than the sum of its parts . 
we use this great euphemism , trial and mistake , which is unimportant . 
but if you ask the indians , say the plant speaks to us . so 
what does this tribe mean ? 
the cofan have 17 variants at ayahuasca , which they all have at great distance in the forest , which are very visible to our eyes as a kind of . 
and then you ask them how they can justify their taxonomy . and they say , &quot; i thought you understand something about plants . 
i mean , you know , nothing at all . and i said , &quot; no . so 
it turns out that you can see each of the 17 variants on full moon , and they sing to one in a different pitch . 
now , that doesn &apos;t give you a phd in harvard . but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting stamina . well , the problem is that even those who are among us who have sympathy for the difficult situation of the natives , they are considered orginian and colorful . but somehow they have to limit them to the past , while the real world , that is , our world , is progressing . 
so the fact is that you &apos;re going to look at the 20th century in 300 years , not for its wars or technical innovations , but rather as for an era in which we &apos;re here to be present , and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on earth on earth . either actively supported or passively accepted . so the problem is not change . 
all cultures have repeatedly taken part in dance with new possibilities for life . 
and the problem is not technology at all . 
the sioux indians stopped at sioux no less than they bowed their bow and arrow tasks than the americans . americans stopped being when they were horse and horse @-@ drawn cars 
, tasks that threaten change and technology . the integrity of the ethnosphere it &apos;s power . the ugly face of the rule and 
wherever you look at the world , you see . you will discover that these cultures are not dedicated to destruction . these are dynamic peoples whose existence is characterized by recognizable forces . these are peoples whose capacity is to be adapted . whether it &apos;s a monstrous deforestation , in the home country of penan , a nomadic people from southeast asia , sarawak , a people who have been free to live in the forest a generation ago , 
and now become slavery and prostitution . on the riverbank was humiliated from where you can see that even the river with the mud is polluted , which is almost half borneo into the south china sea . it seems to float from where japanese freighters are watching the horizon . they are ready to use their ships with raw tree trunks that they can take from the forest . or , as in the case of the yanomami , 
where there are pathogens that were introduced during the gold rush . 
or if we go up into the mountains of tibet , where i &apos;m looking for a lot of stuff . will you see the ugly face of political dominance ? 
you know , the genocide , the physical extinction of people , is generally condemned . but the ethnocide , the destruction of the way of life . people will not only not be condemned , but also generally and widely regarded as part of a development strategy . 
and you can &apos;t see tibet &apos;s suffering . if you don &apos;t want to experience it at the lowest level , 
i went to a young colleague , 6000 miles from chengdu in western china , across the country , through southeast tibet , to lhasa . and only when i came to lhasa did i see the face behind the statistics , of which you hear 6000 saints , monuments that are in debris and ashes , turned . 1.2 million people who have been killed by the cadres during the cultural revolution . the father of 
this young man was born as a follower of the panchen lama . 
that meant that he was killed during the chinese invasion immediately . 
his uncle fled with her holiness to the diaspora . people in nepal brought 
his mother was imprisoned as punishment for the crime , affluent to be . 
he was born at the age of two in prison to be smuggled under her skirt . since they were not able to live without him . 
the sister who did this brave act was taken to an educational camp . 
one day she accidentally stepped out of a bracelet , maos . and for this violation , she had to go to a heavy labour camp for seven years . 
the suffering of tibet can be unbearable . but the redeeming spirit of men is something unforgettable . 
and in the end , we &apos;re really in front of an election . do we want to be in a monochromatic world of monotony or in a polychromatic world of diversity ? 
margaret mead , the great anthropologist , said before she died that it was her greatest fear . that while we are heading towards a thread of uncreative generic world view , we are not only moving the entire spectrum of human imagination to a narrowed way of thinking , but also seeing that one day we are coming up from a dream and forgetting that it has ever been possible for others . 
and it &apos;s humiliating to think that our genus might have been living for 600,000 years , maybe . 
the neolithic revolution , which brought agriculture to us and brought us to the cult of the seed grain at this moment . the poetry of the shaman through the prose of the priesthood replaced and hierarchy , specialization and surplus created , found before only 10,000 years ago . 
modern industrial world , as we know it , is barely 300 years old . 
well , this superficial story doesn &apos;t tell me that we &apos;re all responding to the challenges we &apos;re facing in the next millennia , and we &apos;re going to have to face them . 
if we look at these countless world cultures according to the meaning of humanity , they answer with 10,000 different voices . 
and in this song , we &apos;re going to rediscover the possibility of being what we are , people with full consciousness , who are aware of the importance of giving all people and gardens a space to flourish . it is necessary to ensure that : and there are great moments of optimism . 
here &apos;s a photo that i took at the northern end of the baffin islands . when i was on the narwhal hunt with inuits , and this man , olaya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather . 
the canadian government is not always very good at the inuit . and during the 1950s , in the course of establishing our rule , they were forced to move to settlements . the grandfather of 
this old man refused to family . 
the fear of his life had taken him all weapons and all tools . 
now you have to know that the inuit is not afraid of the cold . they used them to their advantage . 
the slide rails of their sled were originally made of fish wrapped in caricature skin . 
the grandfather of the man was not afraid of the arctic night or the blowing storm . 
he slipped outside , let his pants out of seal fur down , and threw them in his hand . and when the feces started to freeze , he formed them into the shape of a knife . 
he sprayed saliva on the sides of the sewage knife . and when it was completely frozen , he struck a dog so that 
he could skimmed the dog and improvised a tableware . the skeleton of the dog and improvised a sledge , spun another dog , and vanished over the ice floes with the fecal knife on the belt . 
so you can &apos;t do anything . and this is in many ways a symbol of resistance of the inuit and all the natives on the planet . 
the canadian government gave the inuit in april 1999 the full control over a territory back to . that &apos;s bigger than california and texas together . 
it &apos;s our new home country . and it &apos;s called nunavut . 
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all mineral deposits . 
an amazing example of how a nation , a state , can make reparations with its inhabitants 
and reach them . and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious . at least for those of us who are heading towards these distant goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not far away at all . 
they are the home countries of someone . 
they represent parts of human imagination that have been going back to the past and that have become for all of us the dreams of these kids , like the dreams of our own children , part of the geography of hope . 
what we did at national geographic is try to believe that we politicians never have anything to achieve . 
we believe that polemics , we believe that polemics is not convincing . but we believe that storytelling is changing the world . and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website receives 35 million hits every month . 
156 nations send our tv channel . 
our magazines are read by millions . 
and we &apos;re doing a number of trips to the ethnosphere where we &apos;re going to see our audience in places of such cultural wonders that they &apos;re going to be blinded by what we &apos;ve seen . and hopefully they will be one by one , the central revelation of anthropology , that these world is worthy of it , to be able to exist in different ways , to be able to live in a truly multicultural , pluralistic world 
where the wisdom of wisdom is shared by all human beings for our common well @-@ being . 
thank you . 
i &apos;m going to give you some of the things that i &apos;m going to tell you about my book that cover you with other things that you &apos;ve heard about , and try to make connections . if you don &apos;t notice this , 
i want to start with what i &apos;m calling official dogma . 
the official dogma of what 
the official belief of all western industrial societies . 
the official dogma is : if our goal is to maximize the welfare of our citizens , this is what is happening mainly through maximizing freedom . 
the reason for this is that freedom is inherently good value for itself , useful and essential for humanity . 
if people have freedom , everyone is acting independently , to protect things . and nobody has to decide for us : 
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choices . 
the more choices people have , the more freedom . and the more freedom you have , the more common good . have you got it ? 
this is what i think is so deeply rooted in us that there is no sense of being there , in questioning it . 
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives . 
i &apos;ll give you some examples of what makes modern progress possible . 
this is my supermarket . no big , just 
short , a little bit of salad dressings . there are 
175 dressings in my supermarket . if you want to add the 10 different native olive oils and 12 balsamic vinegar varieties you could buy to create a large number of your own salad designs , in the unlikely case that you don &apos;t have one of the 175 in the store . 
so this is how the supermarket works . 
then go to an electronic store to create a stereo system . speakers , cd player , cassette recorder , radio amplifier and in this one electronics store , there are so many stereo systems . 
we can save 6.5 million different stereo systems , from the components that are used in this business . 
you have to admit . this is a great selection . 
in other areas , the world of communication . 
there was a time . when i was a boy , you got every telephone service you wanted , as long as he was coming from ma bell . 
you rented the phone and you didn &apos;t buy it as 
a result . and that &apos;s never broken the phone . 
these days are over . 
we now have almost an infinite selection of phones . especially in the world of mobile phones . 
these are the mobile phones of the future . 
my favorite is the one in the middle mp3 player , nasal hair trimmer and crème @-@ brû<unk> flambierer . 
and if you have not yet done so in your business , you should . be sure you can do that soon . 
it makes people feel like they &apos;re going to go into business and ask this question , 
&quot; do you know the answer to this question ? 
the answer is no . 
it is impossible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much for 
other areas of life . and much more important than shopping , the same goes for the explosion of choices , 
health care . in the united states , it &apos;s no longer the case that you go to the doctor . and he tells you what to do . 
instead , you go to the doctor . and the doctor says to you , &quot; we could do a . or b make 
a has these advantages and risks . 
b has these advantages and risks . what do you want to do ? 
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot; 
the doctor says , &quot; a has these advantages and risks , and b has those benefits and risks . 
what do you want to do ? 
and they say , &quot; if you were me , doctor , what would you do ? &quot; 
and the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . 
the result is patient autonomy . that sounds like a good thing . but it shifts the burden of responsibility for the meeting of decisions taken by someone who has something to know , namely from the doctor to someone who knows nothing and most likely is ill , and therefore not in the best condition to decide , namely the patient . 
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for prescription @-@ related people . drugs for people like you and me . what if you think , don &apos;t make sense ? because we don &apos;t buy them . 
why do you advertise us ? if we can &apos;t buy because 
they expect us to give the doctor the next morning call . and to make a change to the prescription , ask 
something as profound as our identity is . now a question of choice : how this film should show ? 
we don &apos;t inherit identity . we invent them . 
and we invent ourselves so often as we like . 
so every day . if you have to wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be . 
in relation to marriage and family , once the standard assumption was : almost everyone had one , and they married so quickly , and got children as fast as they could . 
the only real choice was who , not when , and not . what they did after that 
, today , is to have everything easy . 
i teach wonderfully . intelligent students and i &apos;ll give you 20 % less work than before , 
and not because they &apos;re less smart or because they &apos;re less careful . they &apos;re less careful , 
but because they &apos;re busy with other things . you ask yourself , &quot; should i marry or not ? &quot; now or 
later , i &apos;m supposed to have kids or make careers . they are 
all engaging questions . 
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions . even if you don &apos;t do your tasks and don &apos;t have a good grade in my course . 
and you should do that in fact . these are important questions to be answered : 
work . we are blessed . as carl has pointed out , technology that allows us to take every minute . every day from every place on the planet to work , except for randolph hotel . 
there is also a corner from which i don &apos;t tell anybody , where the wlan works . 
i &apos;m not saying anything . and i want to use 
this incredible freedom of choice . in terms of work , making decisions , making again and again and again . whether we should work or not . 
we can help our kids play football , watch with our mobile phone . on the one hip and on the other hip and on our laptop , probably on our lap . 
and even if they &apos;re all off every minute in which we &apos;re giving our child mutilation of a football game . let us also ask ourselves : should i take this call ? 
the email answers the letter . 
and even if the answer to the question is no , it will change your experience of football playing your child . very different from what it would have been . 
everywhere we look , big and small things , material things and lifestyle . is a question of choice ? 
and the world in which we lived saw it look like this . 
so i want to say that there were some choices . but not everything was a question of choice . 
and the world in which we now live sees it like this . 
and the question is , are these good or bad news ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know what &apos;s good about it . so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it . 
all these choices have two effects : two negative effects on people , 
one effect . paradoxically , he &apos;s paralyzing instead of liberating , 
with so many options from the way you choose , and that &apos;s what you can do . is it very difficult for people to decide at all ? 
i &apos;m going to give you another drastic example . for this purpose , a study on investment in voluntary retirement provision . 
a colleague of mine had access to investment files from vanguard , the giant fund company of about one million employees . and about 2000 different workstations . 
and what she found was , per 10 investment funds offered by the employer , the participation was 2 percent lower . 
they offer 50 investment funds , 10 percent fewer employees . take part as if you only offer 5 . why ? 
because it &apos;s 50 investment funds . the options are available to choose from , so it &apos;s hard to decide . which one should choose that they want to postpone it tomorrow . and then tomorrow . 
and then tomorrow and tomorrow . and tomorrow . and tomorrow , of course , never comes . 
understand that this is not just what humans call dog food , food . if you retire , because you &apos;re not enough money to get back , it also means making decisions . so hard is that they have great investment opportunities for their employers , which 
do not give participation . give up to $ 5000 per year to from the employer who is happy to have their contribution to increase . 
paralysis is a consequence of too many choices . 
and i think it &apos;s a matter of making the world look like this . you want to make the decision really right ? if it is for all eternity right they 
don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment fund . or even . the wrong salad dressing . 
so that &apos;s one effect . the other effect is that even if we have overcome paralysis and have a decision , the end of the decision is less satisfied with the outcome of the selection . as if we had had the opportunity to distinguish between less opportunities , 
and there are several reasons for this . one of them 
is conditioned by the large selection of different salad dressings . if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect . and what salad dressing is perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that you &apos;re making a different decision . and what &apos;s happening is this pictorial . presented alternative leads to you making the decision regret . and this repentance has a negative effect on the satisfaction that you have made of your decision . 
even if it is a good decision . 
the more opportunities there are , the easier it is to do nothing to regret . that &apos;s disappointing for the choice you make . 
second , what economists call oppertunity costs . dan 
gilbert has a big point this morning , by telling us how much the way the species is in which we evaluate things depends on how much we do compare it . 
well . if there are a lot of alternatives to consider , it &apos;s easy to imagine attractive properties , alternatives that exclude them . that makes them less satisfied . with the alternatives you have chosen . 
here &apos;s an example of the things you don &apos;t know of as new yorkers . sorry . but 
here &apos;s what you should have thought . 
here &apos;s a couple of the hamptons . 
very expensive properties , beautiful 
beach , great day . you &apos;ve got it all for yourself . 
what could be better ? 
damn ! the man thinks it &apos;s august . everyone in my neighborhood is gone . 
i could go straight in front of my house . 
and he spends 2 weeks thinking of being persecuted by him who has missed the opportunity . day after day , a great parking lot to have . 
oppertunitätcost reduces the satisfaction we have achieved through our selection . even if what we &apos;ve chosen is fantastic . 
and the more opportunities to choose from , the more attractive properties of this selection will be . in the cost of oppertunity , 
this is another example . 
well , this cartoon makes some statements . 
he makes a statement about it in living in the now , and maybe about slowly getting things done . 
but an important point he makes is always who she &apos;s going to be for one thing . decide to do other things not to do . and these other things like many attractive properties . and it &apos;s going to be what you &apos;re going to do , less attractive . 
thirdly , escalation of expectations . 
this has hit me . when i exchange my jeans , 
i wear jeans . almost all the time . and 
there was a time when it was just jeans of a kind . and they bought them . and they didn &apos;t fit badly . they were incredibly uncomfortable . and if you want to wear them long enough and wash them often enough , they started to get involved . 
ok . feeling so , to get new jeans , i went . after many years of wearing the old ones , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a pair of jeans . here &apos;s my size . 
and the seller said , &quot; do you want slender ? &quot; easy to attach or wide , do 
you want buttons ? or zipper , stone or acid washed . 
do you want jeans ? with holes 
you want to cut down far . kegelig blah blah blah and so on , he told me , &quot; 
my jaw was down . and after i recovered , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to see the way that used to be the only way . 
he had no idea what that was . so i spent an hour trying to get all these damn jeans and drank the business . and i say the truth with the best matching jeans i can ever have . 
i had better . all this selection enabled me to make it better . 
but i felt worse , 
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to tell myself that i was . 
the reason i &apos;m getting worse was that i was having all these available opportunities . my expectations for what a good couple of jeans are . did they go up ? 
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations when it was only in a kind of 
way that they were in 100 species , damn . one of them would have been perfect . 
and what i got was good . but it wasn &apos;t perfect . 
and so i compared what i had gotten to what i had expected . and what i had was disappointing in comparison to what i had expected . 
adding options in the life of the people increases inevitably . the expectations people have about how good these opportunities are to be . 
and this leads to less satisfaction with the results . even if the results are good , no 
one in the world of marketing . 
does this know ? because if you knew , you would not all know what it &apos;s all about . 
the truth is more like this . 
the reason is this . all the better than anything worse than everything worse than anything worse . was it for people possible to experience ? that a pleasant and surprising surprise . 
today , in the world where we live . we wealthy industrialized citizens with perfection as expectation . the best thing you ever can hope for is that things are so good as you &apos;re doing from them . 
they will never be pleasantly surprised because their expectations are high , my expectations . 
the secret to happiness that &apos;s what they all came for . the secret to happiness is low expectations . 
i would like to say a short autobiographical moment that i &apos;ve married to a woman . and it &apos;s really very wonderful . 
i wouldn &apos;t have been able to do better . i have not been putting down 
but settling down is not always the case . a bad thing . 
ultimately , a consequence of buying a poorly seated jeans . if there &apos;s only one way to buy , it &apos;s that if you &apos;re dissatisfied and you &apos;re wondering why who &apos;s responsible . the answer is clear : the world is responsible . 
what would you have done ? 
if hundreds of different types of jeans are available and you buy a one that &apos;s disappointing . and they ask , &quot; why ? &quot; who is responsible ? is 
it just as ? it is clear that the answer to the question is : they would 
have been better off . 
with 100 different types of jeans in the shop window , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes . 
and so when people make decisions , and even when the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about that . they accuse themselves . 
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world . in the last generation i 
think a significant , not the only one . but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression . and suicide is also that people have experienced . the disappointing ones are because their standards are so high . and then , if you look at these experiences , you have to think it &apos;s your fault . 
and so the balance sheet result is that we generally do better . lens : and we feel worse . 
so let me remind you . 
this is the official dogma . one is that we all think is right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true . 
there is no question of choosing something better than not . but it doesn &apos;t follow the more choice . better than something else . 
there &apos;s a magic amount . i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s . 
i &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;re going to have missed this point for a long time , when we &apos;re going to improve our common good . 
now , as a principle , i &apos;m almost finished , as a principle question . the thing to think about is what all these choices allow . in industrialized societies , the material is wealth . 
there are many places in the world . and we &apos;ve heard of many of you who don &apos;t have the problem of too much choice . 
your problem is that you have too little . 
so things about which i &apos;m talking are a weird problem , the modern rich western societies . 
and what &apos;s so frustrating ? and steve &apos;s annoying . levitt gave them yesterday that these expensive and hard to fix ones , child seats , don &apos;t help . 
this is a waste of money . 
i &apos;m telling you that these expensive , complicated decisions . it &apos;s not just that they &apos;re not helping . 
they even hurt . 
they ensure that we get worse , because we &apos;re getting worse . 
if some of what people in our society can make choices in societies were postponed , in societies where people have too little choice , they don &apos;t only improve the lives of people , but also our dignity . economists call this a pareto @-@ improvement application . 
income redistribution will ensure that everyone is better off . not only the poor , because all this great selection is plaguing us . 
please read this cartoon and a sophisticated person , &quot; ah , what knows ? &quot; this fish . 
you don &apos;t know anything possible . in this goldfish glass , fantasy 
impoverished a short @-@ sighted view of the world . and that &apos;s the way i &apos;m going to read it first . 
the more i thought about it , the more i came to it . the view that the fish knows something . 
because the truth is that if you put the goldfish glass in place , everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . they have paralysis . 
if you break the goldfish glass so that everything is possible , lower the satisfaction . 
they increase paralysis and lower satisfaction . 
everyone needs a goldfish glass . 
this is certainly too limited , perhaps also for the fish . but definitely for us . 
but the absence of a metaphorical goldfish glass is a recipe for misery . and i guess disaster . 
thank you .
