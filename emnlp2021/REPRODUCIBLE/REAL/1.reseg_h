last year , i did these two slides , to show you how i can see that the arctic ice cap that &apos;s going to last for nearly three million years , the size of the bottom 48 states , has shrunk by 40 percent . 
but this expresses no strong enough to do . the seriousness of this particular problem , because it is not the thickness of the ice , in some sense , 
the arctic ocean cap is the beating heart of our global climate system . 
they grow in winter and shrink in winter and summer . 
the next slide that i &apos;m going to show you is a time lapse , which has been happening in the last 25 years . this is 
the continuous ice marked with red . 
how to see it , it grows on the dark blue marked . this is the annual ice cream in winter . and it shrinks in summer , and 
the so @-@ called &quot; dauereis &quot; , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which flows out of the body here . 
in 25 years , it will be from here to here , gone . 
this is a problem because the problem of warming the frozen ground to the arctic ocean is that it &apos;s in the deep ocean , where there &apos;s a lot of frozen carbon . looking which one , when he comes up from microbes to methane , is 
compared to the total amount of climate @-@ changing substances in the atmosphere , could this amount double ? if we want to get beyond this critical point , 
today , in some shallow lakes , in alaska , methane is already bubbling out of the water by itself . 
professor katey walter , university of london , alaska , is associated with another working group on another flat one . lake last winter traveled 
video wow . al gore : you &apos;re doing well . the question is how will it be for us ? 
and a reason is this enormous amount of heat storage is warming greenland from the north . 
this is a yearly dew water flow . 
but the volumes are essentially larger than the volume ever before . 
this is the kangerlussuaq river in the southwest of greenland . 
if you know , how to get to sea level through land ice melting , here it flows into the sea . 
this river is rapidly growing , and 
the other end of the planet . the antarctic , the largest ice mass on the planet 
last month , researchers reported that the entire continent is now a negative ice balance . 
and the west antarctica , which has a few underwater islands , is particularly strong in the melting . 
this corresponds to 20 feet above sea level . so , like greenland 
in the himalayas , the third largest ice mass , you see new lakes up there , which a few years ago were glaciers . 
40 percent of all people on the planet get the half of their drinking water . from this melting water 
in the andes , this glacier is the drinking water source for this city . 
the water volumes have increased . 
but if you seal it , it will also contain most of the drinking water . 
in california , a 40 percent @-@ reduction in snow cover , sierra , was seen . 
this concerns the storage tanks 
and the predictions of how they can read them , are serious . 
this drying out in the whole world leads to a dramatic change in the amount of fires 
and the disasters everywhere on the planet have . in a really extraordinary and previously unconventional way , the number of people is increasing . 
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the last 30 years . 
this is a completely unacceptable pattern of development . 
if you do this in the historical context , you can see what it &apos;s doing . 
in the last 5 years , the number of people we &apos;ve been using has been 70 million tons of co2 . all 24 hours 25 million tonnes of every day in the world &apos;s oceans . 
browse our offers of the area of the eastern pacific , exactly from the american continent to the west and on both sides of the indian subcontinent , where there is a drastic decline in oxygen . in the oceans , 
the largest of the individual factors for the global warming is deforestation , which is 20 percent deforestation , and the largest of them . this burning of fossil fuels ( 
oil ) is a problem . and coal is the same thing , but it &apos;s the biggest problem . 
the united states is a major player in the pollution process , along with china . 
and the proposal was a lot more coal factories to build . 
but we &apos;re starting to change . 
here are the ones that are in the last few years deleted . with some green alternatives that are proposed , 
but there are still some political arguments in the way in which we are in our country , 
and coal industries and oil industries have spent a quarter of a billion dollars last calendar year to apply clean coal , which in itself is a contradiction . 
this image reminded me of something that was 
around christmas . i was running around home at home in tennessee , one billion tons of coal sludge . they have 
it , apparently , in the news . 
this is in our whole country , the second largest waste flow in america . 
this happened to be a christmas , 
one of the commercials of the coal industry . to celebrate christmas , this frosty was 
the carbarian , is a fun , joyful guy . 
he gives him in a shell and fullness , in america . and he helps our economy to grow . 
frosty , the carbarian , is killed cleaner every day . 
he is affordable and adorable and he is a worker who remains in wages and bread .

the most powerful miner is the leader of massey . coal 
video don blankenship let &apos;s just say one thing very clearly . al gore nancy pelosi harry reid they know not what they &apos;re talking about . 
al gore : so the alliance has a climate change campaign that has launched two campaigns . 
this is a very part of the thing that she &apos;s 
video actor . and when coalergy sees us see climate change as a serious threat to our business . 
that is why we have made it the top line . a considerable amount of money to spend on advertising on the way to making it easier to understand the truth about coal . 
the fact is that coal is not dirty . 
we believe that it &apos;s clean and smells of it , and it &apos;s good . 
so we &apos;re going to be worried about the climate change . 
leave your hands to us . ( 
video ) actor saueber coal they have a lot of heard of it . 
so let &apos;s just take a tour of this modern , clean coal factory . 
fantastic . this machine is quite noisy . 
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean coal technology . 
and yet , burning of coal is a thing of the past . one of the main reasons for global warming is the remarkable impact of clean coal technology that you see here . everything . 
browse our offers of the most important things . this is the current clean coal technology . 
al gore : finally , the new positive alternative is mixed with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security . 
video narrator america is in a state of crisis the economy that has been protecting national security , the climate crisis , 
the red thread that connects all of these is . our dependence on carbon @-@ based fuels , like dirty coal and foreign oil . 
but now there &apos;s a brave , new solution to help us out of this miserable situation . 
supply america with 100 percent cleaner fuel , new within the next 10 years , 
a plan to return america to work , to bring us safer , to make us safer and to help us to reduce global warming . 
finally , a solution that is big enough , our problems to solve . 
supply america new find america more ... you &apos;ll find out . 
al gore : this is the last video . 
narrator : it &apos;s about resupply . america is a new supply , 
one of the fastest ways to reduce our dependence on old dirty fuels that suffocate our world . 
man , the future is wind here , sun and a new energy system . 
man no 2 : new investments to be well @-@ paid jobs 
narrator : supply america new it &apos;s time to make reality accept . 
al gore : there &apos;s an old african proverb when you &apos;re quick to be . go alone when 
you &apos;re far away , go together we must 
be far and wide , fast . 
thank you . on the 
last ted conference , there was a introduction to the lhc . 
and i promised to go back to the world to explain to them how the machine works . 
now it &apos;s a time , and for everyone who wants to be out there at the time . the lhc is the largest scientific research experiment that ever has been tackled . 27 kilometers in diameter . 
his task is to make the conditions more accessible to less people than a billionth of a second after the beginning of the universe . and that &apos;s up to 600 million times within a second , 
it &apos;s easy to just be breathtaking , ambitious . 
this is the machine . below the geneva 
we take pictures of these mini @-@ big bang in detectors , 
and i &apos;m working on this . he calls himself atlas . detector 44 meters in the width 22 meters , in diameter here &apos;s a 
spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction , so you can see the size . 
on 10 september last year , the european commission launched the first machine to operate . 
and this picture was taken by atlas . 
it caused immense cheering in the control room . 
it &apos;s a picture of the first particle of radiation that &apos;s going to make the entire route around the lhc , then deliberately moving with part of the lhc to collide with a rain of particles on the detector . 
in other words , when we saw this picture on september 10 , we knew that the people who were working on the machine were working , which is a great triumph . 
i know not whether this is the biggest cheering . or this is what someone who has called the google page . and the home page , so it found , 
it means we have a cultural influence next to the scientific , 
about a week later . was there a problem with the problem with the machine that was connected to these wires here ? this golden wire here , these wires are 
leading 13 thousand amps . if the machine is on high performance , 
now engineers are running among them , you &apos;ll look at them and say , &quot; no . &quot; this is what you &apos;re not doing . this is small wires . 
they can use this . because if you look at them very far , they &apos;re going to become 
superconductors at minus 271 degrees . so , colder than space between the two stars , these can be wires that can withstand the tension . 
in a single connection between over 30 000 magnets in the lhc , there was a manual defect . 
this heat up the wires slightly , and 13 thousand amps met . suddenly electric resistance . 
this was the result . 
now , all this is even more impressive . if you are thinking that the world &apos;s magnets are over 20 tons , and they &apos;re about 30 cm shifted 
, you know ? we damaged the situation of about 50 percent of the magnets and 
we had to remove them . what we also did , 
we conditioned . they &apos;re repairing them . 
they are now all back on the road . 
against the end of march , the lhc will be operational again . 
we will not turn it on and expect first data in june or july to collect to be collected , and we will continue our journey to find out what the building blocks of the universe are . 
now , of course , in a way , such accidents are rekindling . the debate on the value of the science and engineering of the kind at such borders . it &apos;s easy to do this . 
i think the fact that there are so hard things to do about the fact that we &apos;re beyond our borders is making the value of the things . how to use the lhc ? 
i will give my final words to an english scientist . humphrey davy , who , as i suspect , was the one who defended the useless experiments of his apprentice , was michael faraday . the following said : &quot; nothing is so dangerous . for the development of human spirit , as to assume that our scientific ideas are final , that it is not mysteries in the nature that exist , that our triumphs are full and that there is no new worlds to conquer . 
thank you . 
i would like to start by saying to you that you are going to be at the time of your childhood . think back when you &apos;re playing with building blocks while 
you realized how to get your hands stretched out and grab the blocks and move , learn to actually learn to think about and solve problems by understanding and changing spatial relationships and changing spatial relationships . this 
spatial thinking is narrow with it . how we can create a large part of our environment . 
as an informatics specialist inspired by the way we interact with real objects together . with my specialist consultant patti and my colleague jeevan kalanithi , i started to become surprised . what would happen if we were to use computers that were used instead of a mouse pointer that was like a digital finger tip on a flat worksurface ? what would happen if we were to be intervening with both hands and physically seize data and physically take 
it and order it as we want it to be ? 
this question was so gripping that the european union was going to be able to make a decision to explore the answer . and siftables developed short , 
in short , a siftable is an interactive computer in size , one cookie . 
they can be connected by hand . they can also be perceived by each other . they can change their movements . and they have a screen and they have a radio receiver . 
much more important are physical . why not use them like blocks of blocks only by stretching out hands and accessing move , move . 
and the siftables are a sample of a new generation of people &apos;s tools for manipulating digital data . 
and if these tools are becoming more physical and a consciousness of their movements , they &apos;re mutually recognizing each other . and the fineness of our handling of them is perceived . then you can start with the exploration of new and entertaining interaction types . 
i &apos;m starting with some simple examples . 
this siftable is suitable for video playback . and if i want to put it in one direction , that video will be played forward . if i want to put it in the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards . 
and this interactive portrait takes a look at each other . 
if i want to put them side by side , then you &apos;re arousing interest . 
if you are surrounded by one @-@ wire , you will notice that , and you can become nervous . 
and they feel the same way their movements and inclinations . 
a very interesting episode of the interactions that we can see that was that we had to do everyday gestures on data , like the colors , the colors , the way we could pour them on liquids . 
in this case , we have three siftables as color pots configured . and i can &apos;t use them to paint in the color in the middle . where you can pour in the middle , where they &apos;re mixed . 
if we do exaggerate it , we can do a little bit of a bit of a backlash . 
it &apos;s also available some nice things to do in education . how languages , mathematics , or logic games do we use to give people the opportunity to try out quickly ? and the results immediately see how they want to see . 
here i am . this is a fibonacci sequence that i &apos;ve been able to do with a simple equation program . 
this is a game with words , which are a kind of mixture of scrabble and boggle , and it &apos;s a game with words . 
basically , you get every round on every siftable random assigned to letters . and while you &apos;re trying to get words , these are going to be checked through a dictionary . 
then , after about 30 seconds , it &apos;s mixed again . and you have a new combination of letters and new ways to try out . 
thank you . 
this is some children who are on a trip to the media lab . i could not help them to do it , and i &apos;ve got a video of it . 
they have it really loved . 
a very interesting fact about this species of applications is that the most interesting thing about people is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions . 
everything that you say is a very good word . and they know exactly what to do . 
here are some more pictures of people who have tried it . 
this is our youngest . beta testers down there right . 
it was a fact that he was the siftables , stacking only , he was . 
so for him , they were just building blocks . 
this is a interactive animation . 
we wanted to use a language learning tool . this is felix . 
he can create new characters in the scene . 
he can bring them to the scene by lifting the siftable from the table that shows this figure . 
here , he leaves the sun rising . 
now , he &apos;s picking up a tractor in the scene . 
good work . yes , 
by making the siftables shake . and they &apos;re lying side by side , he can let the characters interact . 
his own story invent . 
it &apos;s a story with open @-@ ended . and he can decide how to do it . 
this last example of the one i &apos;m currently in , it &apos;s showing it , is a music sequencer for live performances that we &apos;ve recently developed . and in the siftables , as sounds like leadership voice , bass and percussion , they act . 
each has four different variations . you can select which one you want to use . 
and you can &apos;t hear these sounds in the sequence that you &apos;re going to put into any pattern , and you can feed 
them in any way , just by just putting a sound @-@ siftable on a sequence @-@ siftable . 
there are effects that you can see live changing , like the effects of hall and filter . 
you connect it to a particular one , and you tend to have it set . 
and then , more generally , effects like tempo and volume , which you can see across the sequence . 
so look at what we &apos;re looking 
at . we start in the process of getting the lead in two sequence siftable . and this in a series of orders you can expand and create a little bit more of the voice . 
now add me a bass . 
now i &apos;m going to do some more stuff about it . 
and now i connect the filter to the filter with the drums so that i can see the effect live . 
i can &apos;t see the whole sequence accelerating by moving the pace in the one or the other direction . 
and now i connect the filter to the filter with the bass for something more expression . 
i can &apos;t see the sequence while it runs out . 
this means that i do not have to plan them ahead of time , but can improvise , prolong or shorten them . 
and finally , i can see the whole sequence by hiding the whole volume @-@ siftable to the left . 
thank you . 
how to get to know , then , is my enthusiasm for creating new human computer interfaces that are better suited to fit , like our brains and bodies . 
and today , i had time to give you part of this new design world . and some of the possibilities of doing this to show what we &apos;re doing in our lab . the idea of 
what i &apos;m going to tell you is to get on the road is that we &apos;re on the threshold of this new generation of witnesses , to interact with digital media . the information in our world brings us the information that meets our requirements . 
thank you . 
i am delighted to see the talks with you all . 
i am a writer , i am 
writing books , is my profession . but it &apos;s natural to say more than that . 
it &apos;s also my great lifelong life love and fascination . 
and i &apos;m not expecting that the world will ever change . 
however , recent things are a bit strange in my life and career . that made me feel like that , and it has made me think of my relationship to this work completely . 
this strange event was that i was recently a book written , and i was a little bit more than a book . a biography called eat pray love , this decided differently than all my friends before . for some reason , for some reason , it went out into the world and a big mega event became an international bestseller thing . this is 
the result of the fact that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m coming from . as if i 
were going to be doomed , 
seriously dedicated to doomsfall . and for example , they &apos;re very worried about me , and they &apos;re saying , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;ll never exceed that success ? 
&quot; have you not been afraid that you can make your whole life continue and never again write a book ? this someone in the world is interested in never again . okay 
. this makes it really brave . 
it would be worse , however . if i look at it , i would not remember that i was over 20 years ago , when i was a teenager for the first time told me that i was going to be a writer , with the same kind of fear @-@ filled reaction . 
the people said , &quot; have you not been afraid ? &quot; never succeed in having it . have you not been 
afraid that you will be humiliated by a rejection ? have you not 
been afraid that you will be able to make your life go on for this craft and never come up with anything from it , and that you will die on a scrap pile of burst dreams ? your mouth filled with the bitter , ashes of failure . so 
, about you know . 
the answer that is short answer to : all these questions are , of course . 
yes . i have been afraid of all these things . 
and the one i always had . 
and i &apos;ve been looking forward to a lot more things , which nobody would ever suspect of , like algae and other terrifying things . 
but if it comes to writing , i think since recently , i &apos;ve been thinking about it , and i &apos;m wondering . why is this ? 
reasonable is the logical thing 
that the idea of someone should be expected to be afraid of being able to do the work . he is called to do the job . 
and what exactly is the case with the creative ones ? companies based in the netherlands lot that you tell us unsure about the mutual state of mind . in a kind of way that others do not do . 
my father to say , was a chemist . and i can &apos;t remember any of the situations in his 40 years as a chemist , in which he asked , &quot; whether he &apos;s afraid , chemists , he 
&apos;s got to be . with your chemist blockade john , how are you doing it ? 
it came just not before . know , but you &apos;re going 
to be fair . the group of chemists have been informed about the centuries not to have the reputation of alcoholic , manic @-@ depressive . 
people get us writers , we seem . but this kind of reputation for the world , but not just the writers , but the creative of all genres , seems to have this reputation . mind , monster , to be unstable . 
everything that you do you have to do is to get the bitter death figures from really great heads alone from the 20th century . the young and often by their own hands died . 
and even those who don &apos;t actually suicide , seemed to be beginning from their talents really neglected . 
norman mailer said briefly before his visit to the united states last interview . each of my books has a very little bit killed me a little further . a 
special statement that you have about your life &apos;s work , 
but we &apos;re not even twitching when we &apos;re not even watching someone say this because we &apos;re not hearing this kind of statement for so long , for that reason . somehow , we have the view that we have internalized and collectively accepted that creativity and suffering somehow naturally belong together . and that art is at the end always torment for souls . 
the question that i have asked everyone here today is this : is this idea for the people of you perfectly okay ? 
feel free to do so , 
because with just one centimeter of distance , you look at it . i feel like i &apos;m in this view not at all comfortable . 
i think it &apos;s horrible . 
and i think they &apos;re dangerous . and i want not to watch how they go to the next century . 
i think it &apos;s better . if we want to make our great creative encouragement to live , 
and i definitely know that it &apos;s a great deal of a dangerous thing for me in my situation . to begin with this dark path of presumption , so to speak , to leak down , especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career right 
now . this means : see the i am pretty young . i am just about 40 years old , 
i have perhaps not yet received another 40 years of work . 
and it &apos;s extremely likely that the whole thing i &apos;ve heard from now on will be written by the world as the work that &apos;s being evaluated after the departure of success of my last book , and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to write . right ? 
i say it straight away . because we &apos;re here . yes . now all of you , somehow friends . it &apos;s highly likely that my heart &apos;s greatest success is behind me . 
oh jesus ! what a great thought ! 
this is the way we think about it , which leads someone to do it at 9 a.m. gin gin to get drunk . and that &apos;s what i don &apos;t want . 
i would rather continue to do this work , which i love . 
so it &apos;s the question of how to 
get to grips with some time of reflection , and i think i &apos;m going to write a kind of protective psychological construct to continue writing . somehow , i have to get from now on 
to find a way . and when writing a safe distance to keep between me and me , very natural anxiety , about how the reaction to the problem of being written will be . while i was in 
the last year , according to models for doing this , i was looking for models for this , too , in the past . and i &apos;ve tried to get other societies to find ways to see if they might be better or more sensible ideas about it . as we were , how to help creative people to deal with emotional risks that are associated with creativity , we were able to do so . 
this search led me to the old greece . and that old rome . 
please follow the instructions . because the circle will not change again . 
but in the old greece and rome , the people don &apos;t believe that creativity is the creativity of people . okay . they 
believed that creativity was a kind of divine servant spirit that came from a distant , unknown source to people , to people , to people for inexplicable , unknown reasons . 
the greeks called these divine servants spirits of creativity demons of the socrates . is 
known that he is believed in it . he would have had a demon who would have given him wisdom from afar . 
the romans had the same idea : they called it . this kind of body @-@ less , creative spirit , a genius . 
this is great . the romans thought not really that the idea of a genius , a particularly smart individual . 
they believed that a genius would not have this kind of magical divine being . from the belief that the world is literally in the walls , it &apos;s actually living in an artist &apos;s studio . about the same way dobby , the housekeeper , would come out and help the artist at work , in a way , become invisible . and that &apos;s the result of the work . 
this is brilliant . since there &apos;s it . since there &apos;s the distance from the one i talked about . this psychological construct , which you can see from the consequences of your work . 
and everyone knew that it was like this . right ? 
the artist of antiquity was in front of certain things protected , such as the way too much narcissism was right . 
if your work is brilliant , you could not do anything . for you . book now . everyone knew that you could not do this body @-@ less genius that helped you . 
if your work flopped , not entirely your mistake or any mistake 
knew your genius was . something lame . 
so we have people in the west really long time been talking about creativity . 
and then came the renaissance . and all that changed . we had these big ideas . and this big idea was , &quot; let &apos;s put the human individual at the center of the universe , about all gods and mysteries . and it &apos;s not a room anymore for mystical creatures . the commands of the divine accept . 
it &apos;s the beginning of rational thinking of humanism . and the people started to believe . creativity , completely different from their own individual . 
and for the first time in history , you hear people hear this or that artist . a genius calls instead of being a genius , a genius . 
i have to tell you , i think that was a great mistake . 
know , i think one thing you know is to allow a mere person to think he or she &apos;s like that vessel , like the basin , and the essence , and the source of all divine creative , unknown , infinite . mystery is a little bit too small , too much responsibility to give it to a fragile human psyche . 
it &apos;s like somebody is asking you to see the sun swallow . 
this distorts and distorts whole ego &apos;s . and it creates all these unattainable things that we expect 
to succeed . i think that this pressure to succeed , our artists , of the last 500 years , has destroyed . 
and if the right thing is true . and i think it &apos;s true , is the question . 
can we do that ? 
maybe to a ancient understanding of the world &apos;s relationship between people and the mystery of the creative , to return . 
maybe not . 
maybe you can &apos;t understand the thought from 500 years of rational humanism simply in a single 18 @-@ minute talk . 
and it &apos;s certainly people in the world who are really really justified in scientific doubt about how to get the idea of basically fairies , the people follow , and the fairy @-@ birds on their projects , etc . 
i &apos;m probably not going to see all of you on this journey . 
but the question that i raise is that the reason . not . 
why not do it think so ? 
because it makes just as much sense as anything else from the world i hear . if it comes to the absolutely absolute crazy @-@ making whim @-@ heartedness of the creative process , 
a process that is like any other , as everyone knows , who has ever tried to do something . so in other words , everyone actually here , not always reasonable , is 
acting . in the end , he can &apos;t even imagine himself paranormal at times . 
i had recently had such an encounter . as i saw the extraordinary american poet ruth stone , who was now talking about 90 , the one who was all her life a poet , i was . they told me that they were as they were in virginia , a village , growing up outside in the fields . they said , she would feel and hear , how a woman &apos;s poem about the landscape on the floor . 
they would come to terms with . they said it was like a kind of thundering train out of air that 
was going to cross the country to roll it up . 
they felt when it came , because it would make the earth under their feet a reality of trembling . 
they knew that they were in a sort of moment just one thing that could do . and that was in their words , &quot; race like the devil . &quot; 
they ran like the devil to the house while they were driven by this poem . it was only about the fact that they were quick enough to make a sheet of paper and a pen so that they could get it if it was through it thunder , catch it and put it on the sheet . 
and in other paintings , she wasn &apos;t quick enough . they ran and ran and ran and ran . but they reached the house not only . and that poem rolled through them , and it was . and they missed it . they said it would continue to talk about land . and how they said , after a different poet , are they looking for ? 
and then there was this moment , the part i &apos;m going to never forget . they said that it was moments when there were moments when they almost missed it . 
so you run to the house and look for the paper . and that poem goes through them , and you know . and they take up a pen . it is precisely when it goes through it . and then he said , &quot; it was like it was like you were going to go with your other hand and grab it . 
get the catch up . this poem to his tail and his tail pulled it back into her body and took over it on the leaf . paper . 
and in these occasions , the poem came perfectly and intact , on paper , and it was . but backwards from the last word . and for the first time 
, when i heard that , i thought , &quot; this is scary . this is exactly how my creative work is going on . 
this is not at all like my creative process . i am not the channel . 
i am a mule to work to get to work , i have to go to work every day at the same time , sweat , work , and really torment me unpleasantly . 
but even i , in my mule species , sometimes have this thing striped . 
and i guess that many of you , many of 
you , have done that . even i had work or ideas , which came from a source through me , which were what i really didn &apos;t identify . 
what is this ? what is it ? 
and how do we get into this relationship without talking about it , without losing our mind , but rather , on the contrary ? even with spiritual health , 
to keep . for me , this is the best . living example of how to do this . the musician tom waits i was allowed to see him a few years ago for a magazine . we talked about the situation here , 
and we talked about this . and know , what ? the majority of his life was a tom who embodies the world &apos;s tormented modern artist , who tried to ... this uncontrollable creative impulse that is reflected in him lived to dominate and to communicate with them . 
but then it was getting older and quieter . he told me that he was one day on a highway , in los angeles , he was driving . and since that changed , everything changed for him . 
he went with high speed as he was suddenly a little bit fragment . one melody sounds like a melody that sounds like inspiration . for me , it &apos;s tormenting . hard to grasp . and he will bring them . they are magnificent . he leaks after that . but he can &apos;t do it . 
he has no piece of paper . he has no pen . he has no cassette recorder . 
he starts with this old anxiety , in him ascending like a little bit like , &quot; i &apos;m going to . this thing is losing and i &apos;m going to be lost forever by this song . 
i am not good enough . i &apos;m going to not . but 
instead of panic , we &apos;re hearing him just stop . 
he finished the whole course of thought and did something completely new . 
he looked at the world in the sky and said , &quot; excuse me , can &apos;t you see i &apos;m driving a car ? &quot; 
i look like this . as if i were just going to write a song . 
if you really exist , come and see a cheaper moment . if i look around you , i can &apos;t care if i &apos;m 
tormented by someone else today , 
and i can torture leonard cohen 
. all the work process has changed after that . 
not the work itself . the one was still often so dark as ever and so dark . 
but the process and the gravity of the clutter that surrounds it was lifted . as he saw the genius out of himself , where he was not but anger , he was not able to leave him where he came from , so to speak . he recognized that it was not a tormenting thing that had to be internalized . 
it could be a strange , strange , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the stranger . external thing that &apos;s not . it &apos;s tom who was 
when i was hearing this story , and it also changed a little bit . the species of how i worked and how it got me already before saved . this idea 
saved me . as i was in the middle of the writing process of eat pray love , i fell into one of these ducts of doubt that we all fall into . if we think about working on something and not working , you catch up with thinking , that it &apos;s a disaster , this will be the worst book that ever written . 
not only bad , but the worst of all times . 
i started to think . i should like to just stamp the project . 
but then i remembered that i was thinking about tom in the free sky . and i tried to . 
i raised the question of my view from the manuscript and i said my comment towards a blank corner of space , i 
spoke loudly , listen , you &apos;re doing it . and i know both of them . if this book is not brilliant , that it &apos;s not complete , my fault . right ? 
because you see , you see , i &apos;m all i have , i &apos;m investing . i have not been more than the one . 
if you don &apos;t know better , you have to go here . you have to keep your share of the deal . okay . 
but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what &apos;s going to happen to the devil . 
i &apos;m going to continue writing . because the reason i &apos;m doing this is my job . 
and i want to ask for a record that i am today voting for my part of the job here . 
because on the end , it &apos;s like this : centuries ago , in the deserts , north africa people turned to moonlight festivals with holy dances and music . the hours of the event were held until dawn . 
this solid was always great , because the dancers were professional , and they were fantastic . 
but go and go very rarely , very rarely , something special happened . one of the actors was actually overworldly . 
and i know that they know that what i mean . because i know that they all know that they &apos;re all in their lives before , and they &apos;ve seen such a performance . it was when 
it was time to stop and the dancer was going through a kind of gate . he did nothing else but to do it ever before . 1 000 nights ago but everything added up together . 
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t appear to be pure , human anymore . 
he was arrested from within and was illuminated from below . and all of this was illuminated by a divine fire , as something 
like this . at that time , people knew what the thing was . they called it &quot; at his name . &quot; 
they put the hands together and they started to sing . allah allah allah allah god god god , that is god . know 
, interesting historical footnote 
as a way to see the ethiopian southern spain . conquered brought them this custom with them , the debate changed , in the course of the centuries , from allah allah to allah , to olé olé olé , which is still being fought in bullfights and flamenco dances . 
if a performer in spain has something impossible , something magical , done . allah olé olé allah great bravo incomprehensible . since there &apos;s it . a fleeting look at god 
and that &apos;s great . because we need the same . 
but the tricky part follows the path closest to the morning . if the dancer himself wakes up and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock in a tuesday , and he &apos;s not going to be a little bit of god in himself anymore . 
he is only a aging mortal , with painful knees . and maybe it &apos;s never going to be back to these heights . 
and maybe it &apos;s never going to be someone else who &apos;s name will ever call god again . if he is turning , but what should he do with the world &apos;s rest of his life ? 
this is hard . 
this is a very painful correction . a creative life . 
but maybe you have to be quite a bit tormented . if you are looking for a new version of the new version of the new version of the new version , you will not have believed that the most extraordinary aspects of your life would come from you . 
if you might just believe that the truth is that you are a loan from an unimaginable source for a fine time of your life that is connected to someone else &apos;s . if you &apos;re done with it 
, if we start to talk about it , change . 
this all . so i &apos;ve started to think , and so i think , i &apos;m sure . in the past few months , while i am reading the book that is about to appear as the dangerous , scary , strongly awaited . successor of my successful race , 
which i have constantly said to myself . if i think about it crazy , i &apos;ve got no 
fear , be not discouraged . do just make your job be 
continued for your contribution to help . what is also he , may it be when 
your job is dancing , dance . 
if the situation is stupid , divine genius that leads you to the side , if you decide to spend a short moment in a breath of wonder through your effort to show you . then olé 
and if not , dance your body , 
and olé for the sake of you . despite all 
this , i believe . and i &apos;ve got the feeling that we should teach that . 
olé , for you . despite all this , simply for you to be the mere human love and attachment . for this , because you have to be . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
june cohen olé they 
know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human being genome . and what that means could and could be about the discovery of new groups of genes . 
in fact , we start from a new point . we have the biology digitized . and now try to get away from the digital code into a new phase of biology , and we &apos;re trying to get it into a new phase of biology . 
by making new life , and by building it up . we have always tried to answer important questions . 
what is life ? it &apos;s something that &apos;s happening . i believe that many biologists are trying to get to understand and understand that on different levels . 
we have different approaches , trying to make it to the point of minimising components . 
we have almost 20 years of digitization . as we saw the human genome sequencing , the human genome was changed from analogue world to analogue biology , to digital world . the computer 
now try to get to ask if we live . regenerate . or if we can regenerate new life , or we can do something new . from this digital universe . 
this is the map of a little organism , mycoplasma geitalium , which is the smallest genome of a species that has itself in the lab replicating itself . and we &apos;ve tried to see if we could do this with a smaller genome , even smaller genome . 
we have it done . on about a hundred genes to dispense with , of the 500 or so . the here are 
: but if we look at these metabolic cards , which are very simple , in comparison to what we trust , they tell me . this is simple . but if we look at all of these genes that we &apos;ve got one after the other eliminated , it &apos;s a lot unlikely that this will lead to a living cell that would be alive . 
so we have therefore decided that we should be the only way to move forward . this chromosome actually has to synthesize what we can do to make the individual components vary , and so some of these fundamental questions are asked . 
and so they started to talk to the question , &quot; can we make a chromosome synthesize ? 
&quot; and so it allows chemistry to actually make these really big molecules , which has never been done before . 
and if we do , we can do that , we can start the chromosome . 
a chromosome is so incidental , only one piece of inert chemical material . 
our steps at the digitisation of the life were exponential , 
our ability to use genetic code to write has become very slow , but still , it has increased . and our last point would now be to refer to an exponential curve . 
we have a 15 @-@ year @-@ old start with it . 
it took us some years to start with a bioethical review , in fact . before we can start the first experiments , 
how it turned out , dna synthesization is very difficult . 
it &apos;s tens of thousands of machines around the world , the little pieces of dna that can make . 30 to 50 letters long but it &apos;s a degenerative process . so , the longer you get a piece of stuff , the more mistakes happen . 
so we had to create a new method that would allow us to use these little pieces together and make the mistakes correct . 
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi . x 174 
it &apos;s a small virus . the bacteria kill . 
we created small pieces , made a bug correction , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters . 
the exciting phase came when we were able to inert this piece of chemical and put it into a bacterium , and the bacterium started to develop the genetic code and read it , and it made viral particles . 
the viral particles were then removed from the cells . and the viral particles came back and killed e. coli . 
recently , i started working with the oil industry . and they said that they were going to do this model . 
they laughed more than their , it &apos;s doing here . so think about the fact that this is a situation . in the software , actually , your own hardware can build in a biological system . 
but we wanted to have a lot more going on . we wanted to have a whole bacterial chromosome built . it has more than 580 000 people letters of genetic code . so they thought we were . we build it in cassettes . from the size of the virus , which we can see the size . the cassettes vary , to be able to understand what the individual components of a living cell are . 
design is the key . and if you &apos;re using digital information in the computer to start with , this digital information really needs to be flawless . 
as we saw the genome for the first time in 1995 , the error rate was at one error per 10,000 base pairs . 
we found a lot of errors in resequencing . if we want to see the original sequence , it would never be possible . to get off , 
part of the design is to create pieces . the 50 letters long are and the 50 letters with other 50 letters overlap pieces to make smaller sub @-@ units . so that they fit together . 
we have unique elements here . 
they have perhaps heard that we are watermarks built in . 
think about it . we have a 4 @-@ letter code a , c , g and t 
triplets . this letter , these letters , encode about 20 amino acids . and here &apos;s where there &apos;s a single provision . for each of these amino acids , 
so we can use the genetic code to translate our words . sentences , thoughts , 
at first we only signed . 
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry . 
we have the pieces so constructed that they are not easy to use with enzymes . it &apos;s enzymes that make these repair and repair them back together . 
and we &apos;ve started to play pieces . starting with pieces , which are five to seven thousand letters , they added . this one to another , to make 24,000 @-@ spelling pieces , to reintegrate them , up to 72,000 . 
in each step , we have these pieces in surplus , and so that we can sequence them . because we tried to get a very robust process created , which they did in a minute , and we were going to see . 
we have tried to get to the point of automation . 
so , that looks like a little basketball playoff . 
if we go to these really big pieces , with over 80 percent of the base pairs . then we will not just be able to do this in e.coli . it exceeds all possibilities of modern technology in molecular biology . and so they turned to others , mechanisms that we did . 
we knew about a mechanism that was called homologous recombination , called the one biology uses , to make dna repair , to repair those pieces that can merge . 
here &apos;s a sample of this . it &apos;s a body called deinococcus , radiodurans , which has three million wheel of radiation surviving . 
they see in the upper field that his chromosome is simply apart . 
12 to 24 hours later , the first thing happened again . 
we have thousands of organisms that have done that . 
this organisms can be totally dried up . they can even be used in vacuum . 
i am absolutely sure that life will be in space and that life will be able to move . on the lookout for aquatic conditions , 
in fact , nasa has shown that there is a lot of it out there . 
here &apos;s a picture of the image of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using this process , and we &apos;ve got it . in fact , we have only used yeast mechanisms to design the right thing . the pieces have been made fit for you . yeast then adds them automatically together . 
this is not an electron microscope . it &apos;s a regular microscope image . 
it &apos;s like this : a big molecule that we even do it with the light microscope , we can see it . 
this is a picture of a duration of 6 seconds . 
this is the publication that we &apos;ve just recently finished . 
this is about 580 000 letters , and it &apos;s genetic code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with a defined structure that ever has been created by humans . it has a molecular 
weight of over 300 million . 
if we do not have a font size of 10 and without spacing , we would have to print it . it 142 pages contain : only to make this genetic code print . 
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ? 
obviously , it &apos;s a problem with a virus that &apos;s very simple . it &apos;s a lot more complicated with bacteria . 
it &apos;s also easier . if you look at it in eukaryonts like us , you do it , you just take the nucleus out and you give another one in . and that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;re doing all about the world of cloning . 
and in archaebacteria , the chromosome is integrated into the cell . but it was only recently that we showed that you can see a complete transplant of a chromosome from a cell to another from one cell . and this activates can 
we clean up . this chromosome of a microbial species , roughly said , is these two so far apart as humans and mice . we gave some extra genes to this , so that we could choose this chromosome . we were decomposing it with enzymes to destroy all proteins . and it was very amazing when i was there in a very cell , and we were going to give it . and they &apos;re going to be our very mature graphics . here , 
the new chromosome was estimated to have gone into the cell . 
in fact , we thought that this was the end . but we have tried to get the process a little further . 
this is the main mechanism . the evolution here . 
we find all kinds of species of species . here are the second chromosome taken up , or a third chromosome taken from somewhere . each time thousands of characteristics in just one second to a single species add people . 
so the people who imagine evolution as a gene that &apos;s going to be changed at a time have a lot of biology missed . 
it &apos;s enzymes that have called restrictive enzymes , which actually actually digest dna . 
this chromosome , which is in the cell , has none of the chromosomes that we inserted , and it &apos;s not . already . 
it was built in the cell , and it realized the other chromosome as a foreign material . digested it . and so they had a lot of fun at the end , and we had only one cell with a new chromosome . 
it discolored , blue because of the genes that we inserted , and it was a very dark thing . 
and after a very short time , i had all the characteristics of the species lost , and i converted them completely into a new species . based on the new software that has been developed into the cell , we &apos;ve been able to do this . 
all proteins changed , the membranes changed , the membranes changed when we saw the genetic code . was it exactly that what we were transferring ? it 
may seem like genomic alchemy . but we can do that by making the software dna move things quite dramatically . 
now i &apos;ve argued that this is not the genesis , but it &apos;s not the genesis . this is based on 3.5 billion dollars a year . evolution 
and i &apos;ve argued that we &apos;re probably going to be doing a new form of cambrian explosion , and in that we &apos;re going to have massive new species formation based on this digital design . 
why should we do that ? 
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious that . in view of what we need , 
we are in the process of being six and a half to nine billion people . in the next 40 years , 
the growth of the population in my context , i was born in 1946 . 
today , three people are on this planet for everyone who wants to be in 1946 . within a 40 years , it will take four years . 
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6 5 billion people . 
it will be a challenge to do this for 9 . 
we need to have over five billion tons of coal . 30 @-@ plus billion barrels of oil this is a hundred million . barrels on the day if 
we talk about biological processes , or any process to get the process replaced , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge . 
then of course , there &apos;s the whole co2 from this material that &apos;s in the atmosphere , of course . 
we have now come from our discoveries , from all over the world , to create a database of about 20 million genes . and i want to believe that the idea is that these are the design components of the future . 
the electronics industry had a dozen components . and you see , the diversity of the things . the resulting result is that 
we are encountering a major challenge here , namely the limits of biological reality . and at that of our idea , 
we &apos;ve got technologies today . because of this fast synthesis method , to do what we do , combinatorial genetics . 
we have now the opportunity to create a large robot , and it &apos;s going to have millions of chromosomes a day . 
if you are thinking of these 20 million different genes being produced , or these processes being optimized to be octane @-@ produced , or drugs being new vaccines , we can work with a small , small team of people to change molecular biology . as the last 20 years of science 
and it &apos;s just a few times selection . we can look for viability , we can select chemicals or fuel production , vaccine production , and so on . 
this is a recording of real life design software on which we work , with which you can actually sit down and create new species on the computer . kenn : 
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like . we know exactly how their genetic properties are , and what they look like . 
we focus on the future of fuel from the fourth generation . 
they have recently been using corn to produce ethanol . what &apos;s simple ? a bad experiment is , 
we &apos;ve got fuel . the second and third generation , the relatively soon to come out , will be the much higher sugar @-@ making activities , like octane or different types of butanol . 
but how we think the only thing we can do is to make biology have a big impact without further increasing costs on food or limiting food costs to availability . if you have a big impact on co2 as the source material , it &apos;s going to be . and so we &apos;re working on cells that are going that way . 
and we think that we can &apos;t get the first of the fourth generation fuels , and we think we &apos;re going to be the first generation of fuels . and that &apos;s about 18 months from now , 
sunlight and co2 are a method . 
but in our discovery of the world , we &apos;ve all kinds of different methods . 
this is a body that we have been describing in 1996 . 
he lives in the deep sea , about one and a half miles deep , at almost boiling water temperatures . 
it turns co2 into methane , and it &apos;s using carbon dioxide to be the source of energy . 
we study whether we can use stored co2 . what &apos;s simple to use in production places ? convert the co2 to fuel to fuel . to drive this process . 
within a short period of time , we believe . we could be in a position to do so . a single basic question of life is that of solving it . know , 
we &apos;ve really got moderate targets like the replacement of the entire petrochemical industry , right ? that &apos;s exactly when you don &apos;t do this at ted , where else is a major source of energy . 
but just as we &apos;re working on it right now . the same approaches to the development of new vaccines are being used . 
they have it . this year , they have seen it with flu . we are always a year behind the scenes and we have a dollar to little if we have a dollar to do with the right vaccine . 
i think that the change is going to be made by recombinant vaccines in advance . 
this is what it &apos;s like the future , maybe . with changes , today the evolutionary tree can be accelerated , with synthetic bacteria , archaea , and possibly eukaryotes . 
we are light years away from people being able to improve . our goal is to achieve only that we can have a chance to have a long enough survival to possibly do that . thank you . 
what i &apos;m going to tell you first as quickly as possible is the basic work that is going to be a new technology that we call microsoft part of a takeover just a year ago . 
this is seadragon . and it &apos;s a environment in which people can either be local or away with huge amounts of food and visual data , and they can do it . 
we see many , many gigabytes of digital photos here , the one that you can seamlessly and continuously get up to , swivel , rearrange in any way . 
and it &apos;s no matter how many information we look at , how big these collections are , or how big the images are . 
the majority of them are digital digital photos of a camera . but this one is about the first time , for example , a scan from the congress library . and it &apos;s in a field where the 300 megapixels are . 
it makes no difference . because the only thing that the performance of a system like this is able to limit is the number of pixels on your screen . in each moment . 
it has also a very flexible and flexible architecture . 
this is a whole book . a sample of non @-@ image data . 
this is bleak house of dickens , each column is a chapter to read . 
to prove that it &apos;s really a matter of a text , not a text , not an image . can we do something like that ? to really do show you that these are a real representation of the text and not an image . 
maybe it &apos;s a artificial way of doing this , reading an e @-@ book . 
i would like to recommend it ! 
this is a more realistic case . this is a release of the scorpio guardian . 
each large picture is the beginning of a section . 
and that gives them really the real pleasure . and the good experience . a real paper edition of a magazine or a newspaper to read what &apos;s in itself a kind of medium with several orders of magnitude . 
we have also something to do with the corner of this special edition of the guardian . 
we have a false message with a very high resolution , designed to make much higher than in a normal ad , and we have a very high resolution . and we &apos;ve got additional content added . 
if you want to use the features of this car , you can see them here , 
or other models . or even technical specifications . 
and this is really taking these ideas up , these restrictions on the available space , on the screen , to abolish . 
we hope that the commission will not be able to make pop @-@ ups and other nonsense . this should not be necessary . 
of course , mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this one . 
and i want to really not do much time here . besides the fact that we also have to say that we are going to contribute to this area . 
but this is all the streets in the u.s.a. 
, and all of these are on top of the earth &apos;s earth @-@ wide image of nasa . 
let &apos;s just let us do something else . 
this is now even live in the internet . they can &apos;t check it . 
this is a project with which we can call photosynth , which really has two different technologies that connect . 
the first is seadragon and the second is seadragon , and the other is a very good research on computer vision that is done by noah snavely , a university student at washington university , under steve seitz &apos;s advice at uw . 
and rick szeliski of microsoft research , conducted was a very , very good collaboration . 
so this is live in the internet . it will be used by seadragon . 
they can use this . if we want to use this kind of view , where we &apos;re created by images that we can penetrate through . and this experience of multiple resolution , which is what we have . 
but the spatial arrangement of the images is here . in the end , of importance , 
the computer vision algorithms have these images together , so that they can give the real space in which these recordings , all of which are near grassi lakes , are recorded in canadian rockies , correspond . they see here elements of stabilized energy slides or panoramic image processing . and this is what all of these things were related spatially to each other . 
i know not exactly whether i am still time . i am not sure if i have time to show you other environments . 
it &apos;s what the many spatial differences are . 
i would like to make a straight one of the original records of noah . and that &apos;s from a very early prototype of photosynth , at which we first saw in the summer , to get you the idea of showing you what i think i think it &apos;s really the point behind this technology of photosynth technology . and this is not necessarily the case . if you look at the environments that we &apos;re looking at on the website , 
we had to look at the lawyers , etc . 
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral . notre dame : the only thing that can be done in the computer with pictures of flickr . 
was given the simple notre dame , in flickr , and they &apos;re going to see pictures of men in t @-@ shirts and on the university grounds , etc . 
each of these orange cone represents a picture that is seen as being too belonging to this model . 
so , this is all flickr images . and they all stand spatially on the ground , in this way , in relation to each other . and 
we can &apos;t wait for this very simple way . 
know , i &apos;ve never believed that you know , i &apos;ve ultimately worked with microsoft . 
i am very grateful for the work that has been done here . 
i suspect you can see that you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras . everything is about to be done by the mobile phone camera . slrs : a pretty big one . number of them who are all in this environment , flicked together . and 
if possible , i &apos;ll get some of the strange things . many of them are from faces , hidden , etc . , 
somewhere . here are a number of photographs of the artist . here are you : 
this is actually a poster of the notre dame . this is recorded correctly . 
we can expect the poster to be a physical view of this environment . 
the point is here that we &apos;re going to do things with the social environment . 
it will now collect data from all of you , from the entire collective memory , from how visually earth looks like . and all will be connected . 
all these photos are taken together . and it &apos;s something that &apos;s going to happen . this larger is than the sum of the parts . 
they get a model that comes from the whole world . 
consider the fact that this is the continuation of the work of stephen lawler on virtual earth . 
and that &apos;s something that &apos;s going to be done by complexity that people use it to grow and that &apos;s what it &apos;s going to be doing for the user with the application . always bigger , 
their own photos are going to be . with metadata signposted , which is another person entering , 
if the person who is bothering to do so and all of these saints have labeled himself and tells who they all are . then the time my photo of the notre dame cathedral suddenly gets connected with all these data . and i can &apos;t see it as a starting point to go into this room , dive into this metaverse , take photos of other people , and so i can use some kind of cross @-@ modal social experience with the use of other providers . 
and of course by @-@ product , all of this is the immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the world that are not only superflights or satellite images , and so on , but also collective memory . 
thank you . 
chris anderson : i understand you . right ? your software allows you to create a specific time within the system within the next few years all the images that someone has in the world used together . in principle , 
it is linked to each other . yes . they make nothing else than discovering , if you want , it creates hyperlinks between the images . 
and they do this because of the content in the pictures , 
and that &apos;s really exciting . if you are interested in the abundance of semantic information that is many of these images , how 
if you want to find a web search for images where you enter sentences and the text of the website contains many information about which images you want to see ? but how about 
it if the world &apos;s picture were to take you with all your pictures ? then it &apos;s 
the size of the semantic cross @-@ connection , and the abundance that comes from it , really enormous . 
it &apos;s a classic network effect . 
ca blaise this is really incredible . thank you . baa have 
you got it ? thank you . know , one of the big folks in traveling . and a single joy with the world of ethnographic research is together with the people to be living in the world that are still interested in the old days , which are able to remember their past in the wind , to get on with stones smoothed by rain . touch the mouse in the bitter leaves . the plants taste simple . 
this knowledge that jaguar shamans are still beyond the milky way , or that the meaning of myths of the elders of inuit is still of great importance , or that in the himalayas the buddhists still have the breath of dharma , or that they are still alive . does it mean that the central revelation of anthropology is remembered ? this is the idea that the world is in the world where we live , not in an absolute sense , but only as an model , the model of reality . 
as a result of a group of certain possibilities of adaptation , which our ancestors , although successful , had been able to choose many generations ago . 
and of course , we all share the same adaptive needs . 
we will all be born . we bring children to the world . 
we go through initiation rituals . 
we must look at the unstoppable nature of separation by death , and we must do so . and so it should be not us to be surprised that we all sing , dance . and and art is bringing forth . 
but interesting is the unique tone of the song , the rhythm of dance . in every culture , 
in doing so , it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the penan in the woods of the borneo , or whether it &apos;s the penan . or the voodoo acolyths in haiti . or the warriors in the kaisut desert of northern kenya . the curanderos in the andes or the andes or a caravan factory in the middle of the sahara this is accidental , mr president , with whom i was speaking a month ago in the desert , or even in a yak shepherd , who was on the slopes of qomolangma everest 
, the mother of god of the world . 
all these people teach us that all these people are still living , other ways of thinking , other ways of orientating themselves on earth . 
and that &apos;s a notion that &apos;s what , if you think about it , you can only fill it with hope . 
together , the countless cultures of the world form a network of spiritual and cultural life . this network of cultures encloses the earth . and for the good of the earth , just as important is the biological network of life that you see as a biosphere . 
you can imagine this cultural network of life as an ethnosphere , and you can see it . ethnosphere can be described as the total sum of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations and intuitions that are inspired by human imagination . since the beginning of consciousness , the world has been defined . 
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of the human race . 
they are the symbol of all this that we are . and what we call amazing , eager species capable of ? 
and just like the biosphere is strongly removed , it happened . with the ethnosphere , it happened only with even greater speed . 
no biologist would be able to dare to claim , for example , that 50 % or more of all species are just before extinction , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet this , the most apocalyptic scenario on the field of biological diversity , is hardly in line with what we see as the most optimistic scenario in the field of cultural diversity . 
and the decisive indicator of this is the extinction of languages , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about . 
as everyone from them in this field is born , they were born on earth , 6000 languages were spoken . 
now it &apos;s a language that &apos;s not just the whole vocabulary , or a number of grammar rules . 
a language is an expression of human spirit . 
they are a means of using the power of a certain soul to access a particular culture to the material world . 
each language is like a legacy . forest of spirit . a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities . 
and from these 6000 languages , we &apos;re going to talk today , while we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , exactly half of them are not going to whisper into the ears of kids . 
they will be little children no longer taught . this means that if nothing is done , they are actually already dead . 
what could be lonely than from the silence enveloped ? one of the last of your people to be your language , who speak . no possibility to have it . the wisdom of the ancestors to pass on , or the hope of expecting children . 
and yet , this terrible fate is actually happening to someone somewhere on earth . ca : all two weeks , because all two weeks , a older person dies and takes the last syllables of a old language with him , into the grave . 
and i know that some of the people say , &quot; is it not better ? &quot; so it would be impossible for the world to be a better place . if we all only have one language , we would . and i say , &quot; well , let this language be yoruba . &quot; let them be cantonese . 
let them know how to be kogi . 
and then we would suddenly see that . how it would be if you could have your own language not 
spoken ? that is why i would like to draw your attention today to a journey through the ethnosphere . a short journey through the ethnosphere of the world to try to understand them . what is actually lost is actually lost . 
now there &apos;s some of us , who are so to speak forgotten that if i say different ways of being , i really have different ways of being . my 
take them to the place , for example , this child , barasana , in the northwest of the amazon , the anaklona people , believe that they mythologically believe that they &apos;re going to see the flow of milk from the east in the belly of holy snakes . 
this is a people who are not cognitive between the colors of blue and green , and they &apos;re not cognitive . since the tent of heaven is near the forest , from which people depend . 
they have a strange language . and a marriage rule that is linguistic exogamy , called . you have to marry someone who has a different language . 
all this is rooted in mythological history . the peculiar thing about these great houses in the world , where mixed marriages made up six or seven languages , is , however , that you never hear someone who has a language learning . 
they hear only to listen and start then to speak . 
or one of the most fascinating tribes with which i &apos;ve ever lived , the waorani , in the northeast of ecuador . a remarkable people who were first to be found peaceful in 1958 . 
in the year 1957 , five missionaries tried to get in touch and made a serious mistake . 
they threw shiny photos of themselves . what we call friendly gesture is that we would forget that they forgot that these people were coming from the rainforest in their lives never before had anything two @-@ dimensional seen . 
they raised these photographs from the forest floor , tried to get behind the face or figure , and they found nothing and concluded that this was business cards of the devil and killed the five missionaries . 
but the waorani killed not only the outsiders with the spear , 
they pierced through each other . 
54 % of deaths happened through holes . 
we followed the geneaology eight generations , back and found two generations of cases of natural death . and when we saw people with the emphasis on this , we gave them a message that one of the people was so old that one of them was so old that he died because of his age . and we killed him anyway with the same spear . but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest . the amazing thing was , 
their hunters could get the urine of an animal out of 40 steps away and determine how to smell and determine the animal species that belonged to it . 
in the early 80s , i got a really amazing job when i was . my professor in harvard asked if i could remember that , if i were interested in going to haiti and to see secret societies infiltrating the secret societies that were the foundation of duvalier &apos;s strength . and tonton macoutes were . and that poison that &apos;s used to do this to kill zombies . 
ensure to ensure this sensation makes sense . it was my duty to do something about this remarkable belief of vodoun . and voodoo is not a cult of black . 
magic in the contrary . it &apos;s a very important complex process of metaphysical world view . 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if i want to ask you questions , the big world religions . what would you say ? 
christianity in the united states islam buddhism , judaism or 
what is also the case ? a continent will always be omitted . because the assumption was that it was in black africa that there was no religious belief . of course , there was one and voodoo is simple . this remains of this very profound religious thought , which was found during the tragic diaspora of the slavery era . 
but what voodoo is so interesting is that this living relationship is between the living and the living and the dead . 
the living give birth to the spirits . 
the spirits can be heard from under the great water . answers : &quot; to the rhythm of dance , to the soul of the living temporarily pass away . &quot; so that the acolyth is for a short , shining moment to god , 
deshab say , &quot; voodooists like to . &quot; your white ones go into the church and say about god . 
we dance in the temple and become a god . 
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to be obsessed with the spirit . how can you harm ? 
see the pictures of these amazing demonstrations of voodoo @-@ acolytes in a trance state , the glowing coal without burning . a stunning illustration of the ability of the spirit to make the body so influence that it can endure it when it is transformed into a state of extreme arousal . 
now from all people who i &apos;ve met , they were the kogi from the sierra de nevada de santa marta , in northern colombia , the most extraordinary 
descendants of the ancient tyrannical civilization that has reached the caribbean coastal plain of colombia . and in consequence of the conquest , the first people to move into an isolated volcanic massive , and then they went back to the end . this is a very important step in the caribbean coast . 
in a bloodstained continent , these were people . the only ones who never heard of the spaniards were 
to be conquered to this day , they are being treated by a ritual priesthood , training as a priesthood , but it is very extraordinary . 
the young acolyths are found at the age of three and four years by their families . and in a shadowy world of the darkness , in stone huts at the foot of the glaciers for 18 years , shut down . two periods of time of nine years , deliberately chosen to be the nine months of pregnancy , which they had in their womb , their mother &apos;s womb . spend the night metamorphically in the lap of the great mother . 
and while this is all over , they &apos;re culturally going to be included in the values of their society . dear people who have maintained the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic or we could say that the ecological balance is maintained . 
on the end of this amazing initiation , you will one day . suddenly , out there . and to the first time in your life in your age , 18 , see the one sunrise . and in this crystal clear moment of consciousness , the first light , when the sun begins to rise on the slopes of the amazingly beautiful landscape , will suddenly everything that you see in the abstract be learned ? in astonishing splendour , confirmed and the priest enters back 
and resigns , saying , &quot; look , you see , it &apos;s really like i told you . 
it &apos;s like that wonderful . your need to protect it . 
they call themselves the older brothers , and they say that we &apos;re the ones we &apos;re the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world , we &apos;re responsible . 
now , this level of intuition is going to be very important . 
always when we think about natives and landscapes , we conjure up either rousseau and the city of old rumour of noble wild heralds , which are in its simplification . a racist thought is or is not thoreau and say , &quot; these people are more connected with nature . &quot; as we went to 
be natives , we &apos;re neither sentimental . still , they are being influenced by nostalgia . 
it remains not much space for it . in the malaria @-@ contaminated swamps of asmat or the cold winds of tibet . they have , however , been able to do a mysterious job of nimh on earth through time and ritual , which is not based on the idea of being consciously close to her , but on a far more subtle intuition of the idea that the earth itself can exist only because it can be integrated into the human consciousness . 
now , what does that mean ? 
it means that a small child is born of the andes , who is born in faith that the mountain is a spirit of apu that is his or her destiny . a child who is quite different will become a human being . and a different relationship with this one , or this place , has to do with a little child from montana , who is believing that he &apos;s a mountain , a pile of stones . the worn off can be 
whether it is a place of residence of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant . 
this interesting thing is the metaphor that the relationship between the two individuals and the nature is defined . 
i grew up in the woods of british columbia , and i believed that these forests were going to be there , rounded , and i thought , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to be in the woods of british columbia . 
this made me feel like another guy , as my friends were among the kwakiutl , who believe that these forests are the whereabouts of hukuk and the curved forest beak and the cannibal beak and spirits , who are at the northern end of the world , spirits that they are participating in their hamatsa initiation . 
now , if you start to understand the idea that these are cultures that have created different realities , you can create some of their extraordinary discoveries . z ) for example , this plant here . 
it &apos;s a photo that i &apos;ve just taken last april in the northwest of the amazon . 
this is ayahuasca of the many who have been heard by many of you , the strongest psychoactive drug from the repertoire of the shaman . 
what ayahuasca did so fascinating is that it &apos;s not just the pharmacological potential . this preparation , but its processing . it will really come from two different sources . on the one hand , there are these wooden lianas that are one set of beta @-@ carbolines , harmine , harmolin , slightly hallucinogen . this climbing plant alone is about 100 percent of the way it &apos;s a blue turmoil of smoke on its consciousness . it will , however , be covered with the leaves of a shrub from the family of coffee plants 
called . psychotria viridis mixes 
this plant contains some very strong , tryptamins that are similar to serotonin , dimethyltryptamin @-@ 5 and methoxydimethyltryptamine . 
if you have ever seen the yanomami , you can see how she can snuff this stuff . this substance , which you can extract from different kinds , also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine , 
this powder to snuff is about as much as from a gun run shot at . lined with baroque paintings and the paintings landing on a sea , from electricity . it will not distort the reality of the world , but rather the dissolution of reality . 
i have even talked to my professor richard . evan shultes the man who has the psychedelic erea with the discovery of the magical mushrooms in mexico , in the 1930s , the commission launched a discussion on this . i claimed that you could use these tryptamins not as hallucinogen . since in the moment in which the human being has felt the effects , one no longer has to be there to avoid hallucination . but the thing about tryptamins is that the thing they don &apos;t do is they can &apos;t be taken orally 
because they &apos;re done by a human gut . of course , occurring enzyme named monoamine oxidase , denaturated . 
they can only be used in conjunction with some other chemicals orally . they can be taken in order to denaturate the mao . 
now , the fascinating thing is that the beta @-@ carbolines that are contained in the liane are mao inhibitors of exactly the kind that &apos;s necessary to make the tryptamins that potenate . questions about the question of yourself ? 
how can these people come from a flora of 80 000 species of astringent plants ? this two morphologically not related plants are found in the plants that , if combined in this way , are a kind of biochemical version , so that the whole thing is larger than the sum of its parts . 
we use this great euphemism , trying and mistake , which is what is turned out to be meaningless . 
but ask me , the indians . say , &quot; the plant speaks to us . so 
what does that mean ? 
this tribe . the cofan have 17 variants on the ayahuasca , which they all have at great distance in the forest , which are responsible for our eyes as a kind of appearance . 
and then i &apos;m asking them , &quot; how do you explain your taxonomy ? &quot; and they say , &quot; i thought you understand something about plants . 
i mean , you know , nothing at all . and i said , &quot; no . so 
it &apos;s a question of the fact that you can see each of the 17 variants on full moon , and they sing to one in different pitches . 
now , that brings you no phd in harvard . but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than getting stamina . now , the problem , the problem is that even those who are among us who have sympathy for the difficult situation of the natives , they are considered orginous and colorful . they , however , somehow referred to the past , while the real world , that is , our world , is progressing . 
so , the fact is that you &apos;re going to look at the 20th century in 300 years , not for its wars or technical innovations , but rather for its wars or technical innovations , but rather for an era in which we were present , and the massive destruction of biodiversity and cultural diversity on earth . either active supported or passive accepted , so , the problem is not the change . 
all cultures have changed , time and again , to dance with new possibilities of life . 
and that problem is not the problem of technology itself . 
the sioux indians did not stop any less in being sioux than they bowed and arrow . tasks as the americans did . stop american , be as they were horse and horse @-@ 
drawn cars , tasks , not change and technology threaten . the integrity of the ethnosphere it &apos;s power . this ugly face of the rule . 
and where , anyway , you can &apos;t get into the world . you will discover that these cultures are not the end of the day . this is dynamic living peoples whose lives are characterized by recognizable forces . these are peoples who are driven away by their capacity to adapt . whether it &apos;s a question of the tremendous deforestation in the home country of penan , a nomadic people from southeast asia , sarawak , a people who have been free a generation ago in the forest 
and now live to bondage and prostitution . on the riverbank , the river was humiliated from where you can see that even the river with the mud is polluted , which is almost half borneo into the south china sea . floating away seems to be from where japanese freighters are floating on the horizon . the ready are to build their ships with raw tree trunks . the trees they give to the forest . or how in the case of the yanomami , where 
it &apos;s disease carriers who are killed during the gold rush ? or if we &apos;re 
going to go up the mountains of tibet , where i &apos;m looking for a lot of stuff again . will you be the ugly face of the political dominance ? know , 
you know , the genocide , the physical extinction of people , is generally condemned . but the ethnocide , the destruction of the way of life . the human being will not only not be condemned , but in general and in many places as part of a development strategy . 
and they can &apos;t understand tibet &apos;s suffering . if you like it , you don &apos;t experience it at the lowest level . 
i traveled with a young colleague , 6000 miles from chengdu in western china , across the country , through southeast tibet , to lhasa . and only when i went to lhasa did i see the thing that was behind the statistics of those statistics that you hear 6000 holy monuments that were built in rubble and ashes , and i saw that . 1 / 2 million people who have been killed by the chinese cadres during the cultural revolution . the father of 
this young man was born as a follower of the panchen lama . 
this meant that he was not able to escape immediately during the chinese invasion . 
his uncle fled with her holiness . the people after nepal brought his mother was detained 
when he was punished for the crime . wealthy people were arrested . 
he was born at the age of two in the prison . he was smuggled to get under her skirt to hide . since they are without him , they could not live . 
the sister , who had done this brave act , was taken to an educational camp . 
one day , she stepped out of the box accidentally on a maos bracelet . and for these transgressions , she had to go on for seven years into a heavy labour camp . 
this suffering of tibet can be unbearable . but the redeeming spirit of men and women is something unforgettable . 
and on the end , we &apos;re really facing an election . do we want to be in a monochromatic world of monotony or in a polychromatic world of diversity ? 
margaret mead : the great anthropologist said before she died that she had her greatest fear of being there . that during the time we are heading towards a thread of uncreative , generic world view , we are not only moving the entire spectrum of human imagination to a narrowed way of thinking , but also seeing that one day we are coming up from a dream and forgetting that it has ever been possible for others . 
and it &apos;s humiliating to be able to think that our genus might have been living for 600,000 years . 
the neolithic revolution , which gave us agriculture , and which brought us to the world at this moment , the cult of seed grain . the poetry of the shaman through which prose of the priesthood replaced and hierarchy specialization and hierarchy surplus created found before the only 10 000 years ago took place . 
the modern industrial world , as we see it , is hardly 300 years old . 
now , this superficial story tells me not that we all know how to respond to the challenges that we face in the coming millennia . 
if we want to see these countless world cultures , according to the meaning of humanity , they answer with 10,000 different voices . 
and in this song , we &apos;re going to rediscover the possibility of being what we &apos;re , people with full potential consciousness , who are aware of the importance of the fact that all people and gardens have a space to flourish . assured are the following : and it &apos;s great moments of the optimism . 
here &apos;s a photo that i &apos;m taking on the northern end of the baffin islands . as i was talking to inuits about narwhal hunting , and this man , olaya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather . 
the canadian government is not always the most good at dealing with the inuit . and while the 1950s were in the course of establishing our own rule , they were forced to move to settlements , and they were forced to move to settlements . the grandfather of 
this old man refused to accept the family . 
the fear of being alive had been taken away by all weapons and all tools . 
now we have to know that the inuit is not afraid of the cold . they used them to their advantage . 
the slide rails of their sled were originally made of fish , which was wrapped in caricature skin . 
the grandfather of the man was afraid not of the arctic . night or night , or the storm . 
he slipped to the outside , left his pants out of seal fur and defeated them into his hand . and when the faeces were freezing , they formed a little bit of it into the shape of a knife . 
he sprayed saliva on the sides of the sewage knife . and when it was completely frozen , it struck a dog , so that 
he skinned the dog and improvised a dog &apos;s dishes . this skeleton of the dog and improvised a sledge , stretched a different dog on another , and vanished over the ice floes with the fecal knife on the belt . 
so you can get out of nothing , you know . and this is on many ways . a symbol of the world &apos;s resistance to the inuit and all natives on the planet . 
the canadian government gave the inuit a new initiative in april 1999 , which was fully controlled by an area . this larger is than california , and texas together . 
it &apos;s our new home country . and it &apos;s called nunavut . 
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all mineral deposits . 
a remarkable example of how a nation , a state , can make reparation with its inhabitants 
and reach them . and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious . at least for those of us who have come to these distant goals of the earth , to recognize that they are at all not far from being . 
they are the home countries of someone . 
they represent parts of human imagination . they represent parts of human imagination that go back to past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the geography of hope . 
what we do at national geographic eventually try is that we &apos;re thinking that politicians never ever have anything to achieve . 
we believe that polemics , we believe that polemics are not convincing . but we believe that storytelling is the world that can change . and so we &apos;re probably the most beautiful institution for storytelling , in which we &apos;re in the world . our website receives 35 million hits . every month . 
156 nations send our tv channel . 
our magazines are published by millions of people . 
and we do a number of things that we do in the ethnosphere where we can make our audience places of interest from such cultural wonders . we do a number of trips that we can see blinded by what we see . and hopefully we &apos;ll give you one after the other the central revelation of anthropology . that &apos;s that this world is worthy of being able to do it in different ways , that we have a way of life in a truly multicultural , pluralistic world 
where the wisdom of all is shared by all people to our common well @-@ being . 
thank you . 
i &apos;m going to give you some things out of my book that deal with other things , that you &apos;ve heard about , and try to make connections . if you like this , you will not notice . 
i want to start with what i am calling official dogma . this 
official dogma of what 
the church &apos;s official belief set is about all western industrial societies . 
this official dogma is : if you have our goal of maximizing the welfare of our citizens , then this is done above all by maximizing the maximum freedom of individuals . 
the reason for this is that freedom is at the heart of itself valuable , meaningful and essential for the human being . 
if people want freedom , then it &apos;s everyone of us who &apos;s self @-@ employed to do things that are our common good maximizing . and no one has to decide for us , 
the way to maximize freedom is to have choices . 
the more choices people have , the more freedom . and the more freedom you have , the more common good . have you got it ? 
this is , i think , so deep within us that we have no one in the sense of being able to make it into question . 
and it &apos;s also deep in the world &apos;s lives . 
i give you some examples of what we &apos;re doing today , what we &apos;re 
doing is making modern progress . this is my supermarket . 
no big , short , a little bit of salad dressings . it &apos;s 
175 dressings in my own supermarket . if you want to see the 10 different native olive oils not included and 12 balsamic vinegar varieties you could buy to make a large number of your own salad designs , in the unlikely case that you don &apos;t have one of the 175 in the store . 
so this is how the supermarket works . 
then we go to a electronics store to buy a stereo system . loudspeaker , cd player , cassette recorder , radio amplifier and in this one electronics store , there &apos;s so many stereo systems . 
we can get 6.5 million different types of stereo systems , from the components that are included in this business . 
they must admit . this is a great selection . 
in other areas , the world of communication . 
it was a time . as i was a boy , there i got every telephone service , which you wanted , as long as he was coming from ma bell . 
you rented the phone and bought it . it wasn 
&apos;t as a result . of this , the phone was never broken . 
this is a day away . 
we have now almost one infinite number of choices of phones . especially in the world of mobile phones . 
this is the mobile phones of the future . 
my favorite is the one in the middle mp3 player , nasal hair trimmer and crème @-@ brû<unk> flambierer . 
and should you not do that until now ? in your own business , you have seen it . be sure to be sure you can do 
that soon . it brings people to live in the shops . and it &apos;s this question that 
they ask , &quot; do you know the answer to this question ? &quot; 
the answer is no . 
it &apos;s impossible to use a mobile phone to buy that doesn &apos;t do too much for 
other areas of life . the much more important than shopping are the same , for example , the explosion of choices , 
health care . in the united states , it &apos;s not longer the case . you go to the doctor , you know . and he gave you a say , &quot; what to do ? &quot; 
instead , you go to the doctor . and the doctor says to one , &quot; we could do a . or b : make 
a , has these advantages and risks . 
b : does these advantages and risks ? what do you want to do ? 
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot; 
the doctor says , &quot; a has these advantages and risks and b has those benefits and risks . 
what do you want to do ? 
and they say , &quot; if you were me , doctor , what would you do ? &quot; 
and the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . this 
is the result of patient autonomy . this sounds like a good thing . but it shifts the load of the responsibility for the meeting . decisions are taken by someone who has something to know , namely from the doctor to someone who knows nothing and most likely is ill , and therefore not in the best condition to decide to do so , namely the patient . 
it &apos;s a huge marketing for the prescription . medicines for people like you and your me . what if you think , no sense makes ? because we &apos;re not buying them , 
why do you advertise us ? if we do not buy because we 
can expect you to be able to consult the doctor the next morning . and in order to make a change to the prescription , ask 
something as profound as our identity is . now , one question of choice : how to show this slide ? 
we don &apos;t inherit identity . we invent them . 
and we invent ourselves in this way so often as we want . 
d : so every day . if you &apos;re waking up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be . 
in terms of marriage and family , it was once the standard assumption . almost every one had one , and one married so quickly and got so fast children . as you could . 
the only true choice was who was not , when and not . what you do after that 
, today , everything is easy to have . 
i teach wonderfully . intelligent students and i give them a 20 % reduction in work than before , 
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , or because they &apos;re less careful , 
but because they &apos;re doing other things , they &apos;re busy . they ask themselves , &quot; should i marry or not ? &quot; now , 
or later , i &apos;m supposed to have kids , or i &apos;m going to make 
a career . the two are all engaging questions . 
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions . also , if you have not completed your tasks and you do not have a good grade in my course . 
and they should be doing this in fact . this is important to answer questions . 
work . we are blessed . how carl makes it clear that with technology , which allows us to take every minute . every day from every place on the street , every day , from working on the planet to randolph hotel . 
it &apos;s actually a corner of the world that i don &apos;t tell you about , where the wlan works . 
i say nothing . since i use it 
, this incredible freedom of choice . in terms of work , decisions on making , re @-@ and @-@ again and again . whether we work should we work or not ? 
we can &apos;t help our kids in football , watch with our mobile phone . and so on the one hip and our blackberry , on the other hip and on our laptop , probably on our lap . 
and also , if you turn off all of them every minute in which we give our child a mutilation of a football game . questions : let &apos;s ask ourselves , should i take this call ? 
the email answers the letter , write . and also 
, although the answer to the question &quot; no &quot; is , it will change your experience from your child &apos;s football game . very different from what it would have been . 
everywhere , where we look , large and small things , material things and lifestyle live . is a question of choice ? 
and the world in which we live , saw so much of it . 
so i want to say that there were some choices . but not everything was a question of the choice . 
and the world in which we live now is seeing so much of it . 
and the question is , are these good or bad news ? 
the answer is yes . 
we know that what &apos;s good about it . so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it . 
all these choices have two effects : two negative effects on the people , 
one effect . paradoxical , it &apos;s that he &apos;s paralyzing instead of liberating , 
with so many options from the way you can choose . if it falls very hard for people to get to grips with their choices at all . 
i &apos;m going to give you another drastic example . but they give a study of investment in voluntary retirement provision . 
a colleague of mine had access to the investment files of vanguard , the giant fund company of about one million employees . and about 2000 different workstations . 
and what they found was per cent 10 investment funds that the employer offered , and the participation was increased by 2 percent . 
they offer 50 investment funds , 10 percent less employees . take part as if you were just 5 offering . why ? 
because it &apos;s 50 investment funds . the data available for selection is to make it so difficult to decide . what you choose ? that you should choose it tomorrow . and then tomorrow . 
and then tomorrow and tomorrow . and tomorrow . and tomorrow comes , of course , never . 
understand the fact that this is not just that people are dog food , they have to eat . if you are in retirement , you can &apos;t get enough money . it means that the decisions are taken . so hard is that they have great investment opportunities for their employers to miss , 
by not participating , they give up to $ 5,000 a year on from the employer to the happy one who would have been able to increase their contribution . 
paralysis is a consequence of a disease that has too many choices . 
and i think it &apos;s a matter of making the world look like this . they want to make the decision really right . if it is for all eternity , right ? 
they want not to know the wrong investment fund . or even . this is the wrong salad dressing . 
so , that &apos;s one effect . the other effect is that even the most important thing is that even if we overcome paralysis and make a decision , we end up less satisfied with the outcome of the selection . as if we were able to see the possibility of moving between less opportunities , 
and it &apos;s a number of reasons for this . one of them 
is conditioned by the fact that there are a wide range of salad dressings . if you want to buy one and it &apos;s not perfect . and what salad dressing is perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that the way you &apos;re making a different decision is to make a better decision . and what happens is this pictorial and visual . presented alternative leads to the fact that you have regretted the decision . and this repentance has a negative effect on satisfaction , which you have from your decision made . also , 
although there is a good decision . 
the more opportunities it has , the easier it is to make nothing at all regretting . this is disappointing for the election of the people you make . 
secondly , what economists call oppertunity costs . dan 
gilbert has a great point . today , this morning , he told us how much the way in which the way we evaluate things is depends on what we &apos;re going to compare it . 
well . if it &apos;s very many alternatives to consider , it &apos;s a simple thing to have attractive properties , of alternatives that you exclude . this makes them less satisfied . with the alternatives that you chose , you 
have the right choice . here &apos;s a sample of the kind of things you don &apos;t know of as new yorkers . sorry , i &apos;m sorry . but 
here &apos;s what you would have thought . 
here &apos;s a couple of on the hamptons . 
very expensive real estate , 
beautiful beach , great day . they have it all for themselves . 
what could be better ? 
damn ! the man thinks it &apos;s august , everyone in my manhattan neighborhood is very far away . 
i could go straight ahead of my house . 
and he spends 2 weeks of time from the thought , persecuting that he has missed the opportunity . day over day , a great parking lot to have . 
reduce oppertunity costs , the satisfaction we get through our selection . also , although what we chose is that fantastic , 
and the more opportunities it offers to choose from , the more attractive properties of this selection will be . in the cost of oppertunity , this takes 
into account another example . 
now , this cartoon makes some statements . 
he makes a statement about this in the now living and living , and perhaps about things slowly , doing things . 
but a major point that he has made is always who he &apos;s going to be for one thing . decide on the other things , not to do . and this other thing may be a lot of attractive features . and it &apos;s going to be what you &apos;re going to do , less attractive . 
thirdly , escalation of expectations . 
this has made me meet . as i saw my jeans exchange 
, i wear jeans . almost the whole time . and it was a time when 
there was a time when there was only jeans of a kind . and they have them bought . and they have bad fit . they were incredibly uncomfortable . and if you want to keep them long enough and often enough washed , you have a start to do it . 
ok . feeling so i went to make new jeans to buy . after many years of carrying the train of the old and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a pair of jeans . here &apos;s my size . 
and the seller said , &quot; do you want slender ? &quot; easy @-@ to @-@ install or wide , do 
you want buttons ? or zipper stone or acid washed , 
do you want jeans ? with holes , 
you want to go down far cut . kegelig blah blah blah and so on , he told me , &quot; 
my jaw was down . and after i got back , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to see the way that used to be the only way . 
he had no idea what the world was . so i spent a hour doing this , so that all these damn jeans were trying out , and i drank the business . and i say , &quot; the truth with the best jeans . &quot; i &apos;ve ever had . 
i had it better . all these choices enabled us to make it better to have a choice . 
but i felt like i was worse . 
why ? i wrote a whole book to read about trying to get it to myself . 
the reason for this is that i &apos;m feeling worse was with all these available options . my expectations for what kind of a good couple of jeans are . went up . 
i had a very low expectation . i had no concrete expectations when i was not able to meet them in a way that they were 100 species , 
when they came . damn . a new , one of them would have been perfect . 
and what i got was good . but it was not perfect . 
and so i compared what i did get . to what i did , i looked forward to . and what i had was disappointing . compared to what i had in mind , i was expecting . this is because 
adding options to the life of people increases the inevitably . the expectations that people have about it , how good these opportunities are to be . 
and this leads to less satisfaction . also , although the results are good , no 
one in the world of marketing . 
white : this . because if you don &apos;t know , you would all know what it &apos;s all about . 
the truth is more like the truth 
here . the reason is that , in the past . everything better was than anything worse . worse than everything worse . was it for the people possible to experience the world of the world that is a pleasant surprise ? 
today , in the world , in which we live . we wealthy industrialized citizens with perfection , as expectation . this is the best for you ever hope for , and that &apos;s what &apos;s so good , you &apos;re as good as you expect from them . 
they will never be pleasantly surprised because their expectations are my expectations high . 
this mystery to happiness this is what you all came for . this mystery to happiness is low levels of expectations . 
i would like to say a short autobiographical moment that i &apos;ve been able to marry with a woman . and they &apos;re really very wonderful . 
i would have not been better off if it were . i have not been putting down 
but let down is not always the case . a bad thing . 
ultimately , a consequence of buying a poorly @-@ seated jeans . if it &apos;s just a kind of buying , it &apos;s that if you &apos;re dissatisfied , and you &apos;re wondering , why who &apos;s responsible for it ? the answer : it &apos;s clear that the world is responsible . 
what would you have done ? 
if hundreds of different species of species of jeans are available and you buy a one that disappointing is . and they ask , &quot; why ? &quot; who is responsible ? is 
it just as ? clearly , the answer to the question of the question is , you ? they 
would have done better to make it . 
with 100 different species of jeans , in the shop window , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes . 
and so , when people make decisions and make decisions , and even when the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed . they accuse themselves of doing so . 
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world . in the last generation i 
believe that a significant , not the only one . but a significant contributor to this process of explosion of depression . and also suicide is that people are experiencing that . the disappointing are because their standards are so high that they are so high . and then , if you look at these experiences , you have to think it would be your fault . 
and so it &apos;s the balance sheet that it &apos;s generally better for us . lens and we look worse , and we feel worse . 
so let &apos;s just let you remember . 
this is the official dogma . this is one that we all want to think is completely wrong , right ? it &apos;s not true . it &apos;s not a question 
of something that &apos;s a little choice better than none . but it follows not the more the choice . better is than something else . 
it &apos;s a magical amount . i know not what it &apos;s like . 
i am very much sure that i am not sure that we have missed this point for a long time , in which we have improved our common good . 
now , as a principle , i &apos;m almost finished as a matter of principle . the thing about the thinking is that the thing that all of this selection allows . in the industrialized societies , the economy is rich . 
it &apos;s a lot of places in the world . and we &apos;ve heard of many of you , whose problem is not the one that &apos;s too wide a choice . 
your problem is that you &apos;re going to have too little . 
so the things about the one i &apos;m talking about are a weird problem of the modern rich western societies . 
and what is so frustrating ? and annoying is steve . levitt has given them a story yesterday that these expensive and hard to fix child seats are not helping . 
this is a waste of money . 
i &apos;m telling you that these expensive , complicated decisions . it &apos;s not just that the fact that they &apos;re not helping . 
they do not hurt . 
they worry about the fact that we &apos;re worse off . 
if some of the things that people in our society make choices , in societies , would be postponed , in societies where people have too little choice , not only does life improve for people , but for our dignity to be improved . economists call this a pareto @-@ improvement application . 
income redistribution is going to make sure that everyone is better off . not only the poor , because all these great choices give us plague 
, but finally . read more about this cartoon and the cartoon and a sophisticated person , &quot; ah , what knows ? &quot; this fish . they 
know it &apos;s not possible . in this goldfish glass , fantasy 
impoverished a short @-@ sighted view of the world . and that &apos;s the way the way i do it first read it . 
the more i &apos;m talking about it , the more i came to it . the view that the fish is a little white . 
because the truth is that if you know that the goldfish glass is broken , everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . they have paralysis . 
if you like the goldfish glass , so that everything is possible , lower the satisfaction of the fish . 
they increase the paralysis and lower the risk of satisfaction . 
everyone needs a goldfish glass . 
this is certainly a too limited , perhaps also for the fish . but definitely for us . 
but the lack of a metaphorical goldfish glass is a recipe for misery . and i guess disaster , 
thank you .
