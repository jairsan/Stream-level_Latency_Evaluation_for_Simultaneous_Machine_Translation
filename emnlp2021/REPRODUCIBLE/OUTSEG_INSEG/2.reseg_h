last year , I &apos;ve been using these two slides to illustrate that the Arctic ice cap , which is about three million years old , is the size of the lower 48 states , by 40 percent shrunk .
but this does not express strong enough the seriousness of this particular problem , because it is not the thickness of the ice .
in a sense , the Arctic ice cap is the beating heart of our global climate system .
it grows in winter and shrinks in summer .
the next slide I &apos;m showing you is a time lapse , which is what happened in the last 25 years .
the duration is red marked .
how you see it grows on the dark blue , this is the annual ice in the winter , and it shrinks in the summer .
so @-@ called &quot; Dauereis &quot; , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which flows out of the body here .
in 25 years , it will be from here to here that it will have disappeared .
this is a problem because warming is the frozen reason to get the Arctic Ocean up . in this , it &apos;s causing large amounts of frozen carbon , which , if it &apos;s depleted , is coming from microbes to methane .
compared to the total amount of climate @-@ changing substances in the atmosphere , this amount could double if we were to take this critical point .
even today , in some shallow lakes in Alaska , methane is bubbling by itself from the water .
Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska is associated with another working group on another one , flat lake , last winter .
video : WOW al Gore , you &apos;re doing well , the question is , how will we be ?
and one reason is this enormous heat storage system is warming Greenland from the north .
this is an annual dew water flow .
but the volumes are much larger than ever before .
this is the Kangerlussuaq River in southwest Greenland .
if you want to know how sea level is rising through land ice melting , here it flows into the sea .
these rivers are growing rapidly .
on the other end of the planet , Antarctica , the largest ice mass on the planet .
last month , researchers reported that the entire continent is now facing a negative ice balance .
and the West Antarctica , which has a few underwater islands , is particularly strong in melting .
this corresponds to 20 feet above sea level , just like Greenland .
in the Himalayas , the third largest ice mass , you can see new lakes that were glaciers a few years ago .
40 percent of all people in the world get half of their drinking water from this melting water .
in the Andes , this glacier is the drinking water source for this city .
the amounts of water have increased .
but if they seal , the same thing is that most drinking water will fall away .
in California , a 40 % reduction in snow cover in Sierra has been seen .
this concerns the storage tanks .
and the predictions of how they read them are serious .
this drying up throughout the world leads to a dramatic increase in the amount of fires .
and the disasters everywhere on Earth , have been in a really extraordinary and previously never @-@ before unprecedented scale .
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 .
this is a totally unacceptable pattern of development .
if you do this in the historical context , you can see what it &apos;s doing .
in the last 5 years , we &apos;ve been able to produce 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours , 25 million tons every day , into the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern Pacific , exactly from the American continent to the west and on both sides of the Indian subcontinent , where there is a drastic decline in oxygen in the oceans .
the largest single factor for global growth is that , in addition to deforestation , which is 20 percent , fossil fuel burning .
oil is a problem and coal is the same thing , but it &apos;s the biggest problem .
the United States is one of the two largest polluters , along with China .
and the proposal was to create many more coal factories .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
here are the ones that have been in the last few years , with some green alternatives that have been proposed .
but there is a political struggle in our country .
and the coal industries and oil industries have a quarter of a billion dollars last year spent on applying clean coal , which in itself is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me of something .
at Christmas , the people were running at home in Tennessee , where I had one billion tons of coal sludge .
you have probably seen it in the news .
this is in our country , the second largest waste flow in America .
this happened around Christmas .
one of the commercials of the coal industry around Christmas was this .
frosty the carbarian is a happy , happy guy .
he &apos;s in the shell and fullness , in America , and he helps our economy to grow .
frosty the carboniferous will be cleaner every day .
he &apos;s affordable and kind , and workers stay in wages and bread .
al Gore : this is the source of most coal in West Virginia .
the most powerful miner is the head of Massey Coal .
video : don Blankenship - Let me just make one thing clear : al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid - you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
al Gore : so the Alliance for Climate Protection has launched two campaigns that are going on .
this is a part of her .
video actor at the Coalergy , we see climate change as a serious threat to our business .
that is why we have made it the top line : a considerable amount of money to spend on advertising , and we have to get it going to tell the truth about coal .
the fact is that coal is not dirty .
we believe it &apos;s clean and smells of it , too .
so they &apos;re not worried about the fact that climate change is happening .
leave the quiet to us .
video Actor Saueber Kohle : &quot; you have heard a lot of that .
so let &apos;s have a tour of this modern , clean coal factory .
fantastic , this machine is pretty noisy .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
and yet , burning coal , a burning of coal , is one of the main reasons for global warming , and the remarkably clean coal technology that you see here , changes everything .
look at it exactly . this is the most recent clean , coal technology .
al Gore : finally , the positive alternative is mixed with our economic challenge and challenge . the national security challenge .
video narrator : America is in crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that all connects these is our dependence on the carbon @-@ based fuels , like dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now there &apos;s a brave new solution to help us out of this miserable situation .
supply America with 100 percent clean electricity . new within the next 10 years .
a Plan to America Back to Work - To Make us safer and safer and to help us to reduce global warming -
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
supply America , find more out more .
al Gore : this is the last .
video narrator : it &apos;s about resupply of America .
one of the fastest ways to reduce our dependence on old dirty fuels that suffocate our world is to reduce it .
man : the future is here : wind , sun and a new energy system .
man No. 2 : new investments to make well @-@ paid jobs
narrator : supply America New . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
al Gore : there &apos;s an old African proverb : &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone . &quot;
if you come far , go together .
we need to get far , fast .
thank you .
on the last TED conference , I gave an introduction to the LHC .
and I promised to come back to tell them , how to get the machine working .
now it &apos;s time and for the rest of those who were not there at the time , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever done . &quot; &#91; 27 kilometers &#93; In diameter .
his task is to improve the conditions . they are less than one billionth of a second after the beginning of the universe , and they can do up to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking , ambitious .
this is the machine below Geneva .
we take pictures of these mini Big Bang in detectors .
this is where I work , he &apos;s called Atlas Detector , 44 meters wide , 22 meters wide , in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction so you can see the size .
on September 10 last year , the machine ran for the first time .
and this picture was taken by Atlas .
it caused immense cheering in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first particle of radiation that &apos;s going to make the entire route around the LHC , then deliberately moving into a part of the LHC to get a rain from particles to the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture on September 10 , we knew that the machine was working , which was a great triumph .
I don &apos;t know if this is the greatest cheering , or if it &apos;s someone who created Google &apos;s site , and the home page found that way .
it means that we have a cultural influence next to the scientific achievements .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine , which was connected to these wires here . this problem was this golden wires here .
these wires lead 13 thousand amps when the machine is running at high performance .
now the engineers , among them , you &apos;re going to look at them and say , &quot; No , you &apos;re not doing that . &quot; these are small wires .
you can do that because if you do it very far , you &apos;re going to cool it down to so @-@ called superconductors .
at minus 271 degrees , that is colder than the space between the stars , these wires can change the tension .
in one of the connections between over nine thousand magnets in the LHC , there was a manual defect .
heat up the wires slightly and then 13 thousand amps suddenly met electric resistance .
this was the result .
well , all this is even more impressive when you imagine that the magnets are about 20 tons weigh and the magnets are about 30 cm wide , and they &apos;re moving .
we damaged about 50 % of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we did .
we conditioned them , repairing them .
you are all back on your own path .
towards the end of March , the LHC will be operational again .
we will turn it on and expect first data in June or July to collect , to be able to set our journey on to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , in a way , such accidents are once again igniting the debate about the value of science and engineering at such borders . it &apos;s easy to reject this .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to understand the fact that we &apos;re talking about our borders is that we &apos;re going to make the value of things like the LHC .
I &apos;m going to give my final words to an English scientist , Humphrey Davy , who , as I suspect , when he was defending his apprentice as a futile experiment , was Michael Faraday , who said , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind to assume that our scientific ideas are definitive , that there are no mysteries in nature , that our triumphs are full of numbers , and that there are no new worlds to conquer
thank you .
I would like to start by asking you to go back to the time you were childhood , when you played with blocks of blocks .
while they realized how to get hands stretched out and grab the blocks , and move them , they actually learned to think about and solve problems by understanding and changing things in spatial relationships .
the spatial thinking is close to it , how we can make up a lot of our environment .
as an informatics specialist inspired by the way we interact with real objects , along with my specialist adviser Patti and my colleague Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to wonder what I would be like if we were to use computers that were to be used instead of a mouse pointer that was like a digital finger tip on a flat worksurface , what if we were to intervene with both hands and physically grab data ?
and they sort of could arrange as we want .
this question was so gripping that we were able to go into the answer and to make Siftables .
in short , a siftable is an interactive computer in size , a biscuit .
you can use your hand to move you . you can move each other , you can perceive your movements , and you have a screen and a radio receiver .
much more important are physical , which is why they are just made by stretching out the hands and accessing , moving , like building blocks .
and the siftables are an example of a new generation of tools to manipulate digital data .
and if these aids become more physical and a consciousness for their movements develops , mutually , recognize each other , and the subtleties of our handling with them , then we can work with the exploration of new and entertaining interaction types .
I &apos;m starting with some simple examples .
this siftable is suitable for video playback and if I want to use it in one direction , the video will move forward when I want to play it in the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other .
if I want to put them next to each other , then you &apos;re arousing interest .
if you are surrounded by one @-@ wire , you will notice that , and you can become nervous .
and they feel their movements and their inclination .
an interesting episode of the interactions that we can see was the fact that we &apos;ve seen everyday gestures on data that we could use , like colors , to pour as much as we do with liquids .
in this case , we have three siftables as color pots configured , and I can use them to color in the color in the middle of the water where they then mixed .
if we exaggerate it , we can do a little bit of a bit of backsliding .
there are also some nice ways to get to know education , such as languages , mathematics , or logic games , where we can give people the chance to try out quickly and see the results immediately .
here I am , that &apos;s a Fibonacci episode that I &apos;ve been able to create with a simple equation program .
that &apos;s a game with words that have a kind of mixture of scrabble and boggle , and that &apos;s a game with words .
basically , you get every round , every siftable randomly assigned letter and during you try to get words to form , these letters are written through a dictionary .
then after about 30 seconds , the mixture is mixed again , and you have a new combination of letters and new ways to try out .
thank you .
these are some children who are on a trip to the Media Lab . I could not help them to try it out , and I had a video of it .
you have really loved it .
an interesting fact in this type of application is that you can see people not having a lot of instructions .
all you say is that you make words and you know that exactly what you need to do .
here are another few people who have been testing it .
that &apos;s our youngest beta tester down there on the right .
it turned out that he was the siftables , stacking only .
so for him , they were just building blocks .
this is an interactive animation .
we wanted to use a language learning tool .
that &apos;s Felix .
he can create new characters into the scene by playing the game Siftable from the table . he &apos;s going to show this figure .
here he leaves the sun rising .
now he &apos;s picking up a tractor in the scene .
good work , yes .
by making the siftables shaken and she is lying side by side , he can let the characters interact .
his own story inventing .
it &apos;s a story with an open end , and it can decide how to develop .
the last example of what I &apos;m going to have time to show is a music sequencer for live performances that we &apos;ve recently developed , and that &apos;s where Siftables is called sounds like leadership voice , bass , and drums .
everyone has four different variations . you can choose which one you want to use .
and you can hear these sounds in the sequence that you can put into any pattern , and you can sort them in any pattern .
and you feed them in by eating them , just by adding a sound @-@ siftable to a sequence @-@ siftable .
there are effects that you can change live , like the effects of Hall and Filter .
you connect it to a certain tone and tend to make it a bit more adjustable .
and then , more generally , effects like tempo and volume that you can see on the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s look .
we start in which we have the lead in two sequence siftable feed @-@ in and they &apos;re ordering in a number of ways , they &apos;re expanding and adding a little bit more of the voice .
now I add a bass .
now I &apos;m going to do some more stuff about it .
and now I connect the filter to the drums so that I can see the effect live , and I can control it .
I can &apos;t see the whole sequence quicker by accelerating the pace into which one or the other direction is tilting .
and now I connect the filter to the filter with the bass for a little more expression .
I can &apos;t see the sequence as it runs .
this means that I do not have to plan them in advance , but can improvise , prolong or shorten them while doing so .
and finally , I can see the whole sequence by hiding the volume @-@ siftable to the left .
thank you .
how do you see , then , is my enthusiasm for creating new human computer interfaces that are better suited to fit , like our brains and bodies .
and today I had time to give you part of this new design world , and some of the ways that I could show you what we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the idea I &apos;m going to share with you is that we have a lot of work on the threshold of this new generation of witnesses . we &apos;re going to interact with digital media that can provide information into our world , which meets our requirements .
thank you .
I am looking forward to the talks with you all .
I am a writer .
books to write is my profession , but it &apos;s more natural than writing that .
it is also my great lifelong love and fascination .
and I don &apos;t expect the world to change .
however , recent , something strange in my life and career is happening , which has made me feel like I &apos;ve been referring to this work completely rethinking .
this strange event was that I recently had a book written , a biography called Eat , Pray , Love , which decided to be different from all my previous books from any reason in the world for some reason , and a great mega event became an international bestseller thing .
the result is that I don &apos;t care where I &apos;m going to be treated as if I was doomed .
seriously , dedicated to the demise .
for example , they are very concerned about me and say , &quot; Fear not that you &apos;re going to never succeed in surpassing that . &quot;
have you no fear that you can make your whole life continue and never again have a book created that someone can write in the world that &apos;s interested in ? never again .
okay , that really makes you brave .
it would be worse , however , if I did not remember that I was going to be in the middle of the world more than 20 years ago , when I first told me , as a teenager , that I wanted to be a writer , I was confronted with the same kind of fear @-@ filled reaction .
people said , &quot; Have you not been afraid , never succeed ? &quot;
have you not been afraid that the humiliation of a rejection will kill you ?
have you not been afraid that you can do this craft all your life and never get anything out of it , and that you can do it on a scrap pile of burst dreams ? your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failure .
so , you know , you know .
the answer : the short answer to all these questions is yes .
yes , I &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and he I always had .
and I &apos;ve been thinking a lot more about things that nobody could imagine how algae would be and other terrifying things .
but if it comes to writing , I think recently about it , and I wonder , why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it logical that someone expects that they should be expected to be afraid of getting rid of the work ? to which he is called to do so ?
and what exactly is the creative work of the company that they &apos;re going to get us unsure about the state of mind in a way that other professions don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was a chemist , and I can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist , in which he was asked if he was afraid of becoming a chemist .
with your chemist blockade John , how are you doing it ?
it just didn &apos;t happen . you know .
but to be fair , the group of chemists have been talking about the centuries , not the reputation of alcoholic , manic @-@ depressive people .
we writers seem to have this kind of reputation . but we don &apos;t just have writers , but creative writers , of all genres , seem to have this reputation , mentally unstable , unstable .
all you do is to get yourself the bitter death figures of really great heads . just out of the 20th century alone , young and young , and often by their own hands , died .
and even those who don &apos;t actually begin suicide seemed to have been really neglected by their talents .
Norman Mailer said , &quot; Just before his death , in his last interview , each of my books has taken me a little further .
an extraordinary statement that you have about your life &apos;s work .
but we &apos;re not even twitching when we &apos;re not even saying something like this because we &apos;re hearing this kind of statement for so long , somehow we &apos;ve been in the view of how we internalized and collectively accepted creativity and suffering somehow , of course , belong together , and that art is always in the end torment .
the question I have asked everyone here today is this : is this idea for you ? is it perfectly okay ?
feel free to do so .
because with only one centimeter distance , I feel like I &apos;m feeling like this view is not at all comfortable .
I think it &apos;s horrible .
and I think they &apos;re dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to watch them go into the next century .
I think it &apos;s better if we can make our big creative encouragement to live .
and I definitely know that it &apos;s a very good thing for me in my situation to start to follow this dark path of presumption , so to speak , leakage , especially in the fact that I &apos;m just in my career .
that means you see , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m just about 40 years old .
I may have more than 40 years of work in me .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything that I &apos;ve got from now on will be written by the world as the work that &apos;s being evaluated after the departure success of my last book came right , right ?
I say it straight out , because we are here all of us friends , somehow , right now . it &apos;s most likely that my greatest success is behind me .
Oh Jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts that someone has to get to know at 9 a.m. Gin Gin Gin . and they &apos;re the kind of thoughts that I don &apos;t want to do .
I would rather continue to do this work that I love .
so the question is , how ?
after some time of reflection , I think I &apos;m going to continue writing to be able to write a kind of protective psychological construct .
somehow I have to get a picture of a way to write , to find a safe distance between me and me , and my very natural anxiety about how the reaction to the written being will be .
while I was in the process of looking for models for this last year to do that , I also had a lot of time to look for in the past , and I tried to find other societies to see if they could be better or more sensible than we did , how to help creative people to get involved with emotional risks that might be associated with creativity .
this search led me into ancient Greece and the old Rome .
please follow me , because the circle will change again .
but in ancient Greece and Rome , the people don &apos;t believe that creativity is the creativity of people . okay .
they believed that creativity was a kind of divine servant spirit that came from a distant , unknown source to people , from inexplicable , unknown reasons .
the Greeks called these divine servants @-@ spirits of creativity demons .
by Socrates , it is known that he believed that he had a demon who gave him wisdom from afar .
the Romans had the same idea , they called this kind of bodyless , creative spirit , a genius .
that &apos;s great . &quot; the Romans didn &apos;t really think a genius was a particularly smart individual .
they believed that a genius could not do this kind of magical divine being that was believed to be proverbial in the world walls of an artist &apos;s studio , about the same way Dobby , the housemate , would come out of the room and make the artist , in a sense , invisible in work , and would shape the result of the work .
that &apos;s brilliant , it &apos;s there , it &apos;s the distance from which I was talking , the psychological construct that was going to tell you about the consequences of your work .
and everyone knew that it worked like this , right ?
the artist of antiquity was in front of certain things protected , such as too much narcissism , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at everything for yourself , everyone knew that you could do this body @-@ less genius that helped you .
if your work didn &apos;t flop completely , your mistake , right ?
everyone knew your genius was a bit lame .
so the people in the West really have a long time talking about creativity .
and then the Renaissance came , and everything changed . we had these great ideas , and these great ideas were the idea , &quot; Let &apos;s let the human individual go to the center of the universe , to all the gods and mysteries , and there &apos;s no room for mystical creatures anymore , to accept the commands of the Divine . &quot;
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism and the people started to think about believing that creativity is completely different from their own individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people hear this or that artist , a genius , call it , instead of being a genius .
I have to tell you , I think that was a big mistake .
you know , I think a mere person would allow him to think he or she is , like the vessel , like the basin , and the essence , and the source , of all divine creative , unknown , infinite mystery , is a little bit too much responsibility to give them a fragile human psyche .
it &apos;s like somebody asking you to see the sun swallowing .
this distorts and distorts entire ego and it creates all of these unattainable expectations of the world &apos;s success .
I think that this pressure to succeed , our artists over the last 500 years , has destroyed .
and if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s true , the question is :
can we change it ?
maybe to an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the world &apos;s mystery of creative return .
maybe not .
maybe we can use the idea of 500 years of rational humanism not just in an 18 @-@ minute talk .
and there is certainly people in this audience who really are justified scientific doubts about how to register about the idea of basically fairies , people who follow people , and fairy @-@ birds on their projects , etc .
I &apos;m probably not going to see all of you take this trip .
but the question I raise is that the reason why not ?
why not think about it ?
because it &apos;s just as much sense as anything else from the one I &apos;ve heard when it comes to getting the absolutely crazy @-@ dozing whim @-@ heartedness of the creative process explained .
a process that , like everyone knows , is ever trying to do something about it . so , in other words , everyone here , not always sensible , is actually doing something about it .
in fact , he can sometimes feel almost paranormal .
I recently had such an encounter as I saw the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone meet with the now @-@ over 90 , which is her , but who &apos;s been a poet throughout her life . she told me that when she was in Virginia , she grew up in the village , she was working outside in the fields , she said she would feel and hear a poem about the landscape coming up to her .
she said it was like a thundering train from the air .
the information about the country is rolling to you .
she felt when it came , because it would make the earth under her feet tremble to the ground .
she knew she was in such a moment , only doing one thing , and that was in her words , &quot; Race like the devil . &quot;
she ran like the devil to the house while she was running from this poem . it went only to the fact that she was quick enough to make a sheet of paper and a pen so that she could get it when it was going through it thunder , catch it and put it on the sheet .
in other paintings , she was not fast enough , she ran and ran and ran , but she reached the house , not and the poem rolled through her . and she ran and missed it . she said it would continue to go over land and how she said it would go after another poet , looking for a different poet .
and then there was these moments , the part I &apos;ll never forget , she said , it &apos;s been moments in which she was almost almost missing .
so she runs to the house and looks for the paper and the poem goes through the house , and she runs through it , and she takes a pen straight when it goes through it , and then she said , &quot; It &apos;s like she &apos;s going to grab it with her other hand and grab it .
she caught the poem on his tail and pulled it back . she pulled it back into her body and took it on the paper .
in these occasions , the poem came perfectly and intact on the paper . but backwards , from the last word to the first .
when I heard that , I thought , &quot; This is scary . &quot; that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is going on .
that &apos;s not like my creative work . I &apos;m not like the channel .
I am a mule to work . I have to do every day to work at the same time , and sweat , weep , and really torment me unpleasantly .
but even I in my mule species sometimes have this thing striped .
and I guess that many of you think that &apos;s what they did .
even I had work or ideas that came from a source through me , which I had really not identified , which I could not identify .
what is that ?
and how do we get into relationship with it without having to understand our mind , but rather , even with the spiritual health , keeping ourselves ?
for me , the best living example is how to do this . &quot; the musician Tom Waits , I was allowed to see him for a few years ago for a magazine .
we talked about this topic and we know you what the Commission &apos;s work is doing most of its life . Tom , the embodiment of the tormented modern artist , who tried to get these uncontrollable creative impulses that lived in him and to cope with them .
but then he grew older and quieter , and he told me that he would one day be on a highway in Los Angeles , and there he changed everything for a guy .
he went with high speed when he suddenly saw a small fragment of a melody that was like it was with inspirations , often for him . tormenting , hard to grasp , and he wants to have it . it &apos;s magnificent . he &apos;s leaking after it , but he can &apos;t grasp it .
he has no piece of paper , he has no pen , he has no cassette recorder .
it starts with this old anxiety in him , rising like a little like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose this thing , &quot; and I &apos;m going to be persecuted forever by this song .
I &apos;m not good enough , I &apos;m not able to .
but instead of panic , I heard him just stop .
he finished the whole course of thought and did something completely new .
he just looked at the sky and said , &quot; Excuse me , can &apos;t you see I &apos;m driving a car ? &quot;
I see it as if I could just see a song writing down .
if you really want to exist , come to a more favorable moment again , if I &apos;m looking after you .
if not tortures , today someone else .
go and torment Leonard Cohen
his entire work process has changed afterwards .
not the work itself , which was still often so dark as it was ever before .
but the process and the heavy grief that made it around was lifted when he saw the genius coming out of himself . where he had nothing but trouble , and he was going to leave him where he came from , so to speak , he realized that there was no inner tormenting thing to be .
it could be a strange , miraculous , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between Tom and the alien external thing that wasn &apos;t quite Tom .
when I read this story , I changed it to a little bit , the way I worked and it got it to me before .
this idea saved me when I was in the middle of the writing process of Eat Pray Love . I fell into one of these ducts of doubt that we all fall into when we think we &apos;re working on something and it doesn &apos;t work . you &apos;re catching up to think that it &apos;s going to be a disaster , that &apos;s the worst book ever written .
not only bad , but the worst of all times .
I started thinking , &quot; I should be just stamping the project .
but then I remembered that I was thinking about Tom in the open sky . and I was trying to .
I therefore raised my gaze from the manuscript and spoke my comment in the direction of an empty corner of space .
I spoke loudly , &quot; Hear , you , thing , you , and I both know if this book isn &apos;t brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ? &quot;
because you see that I &apos;m all that I have , I &apos;m investing , I &apos;m not more than that .
if you don &apos;t know better , you have to cross up here and increase your share of the deal .
okay , but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what the hell is doing with it .
I will continue to write , because that &apos;s my job .
and I would ask for a record that I am voting for my part today on the job here .
because in the end , it &apos;s like this : centuries ago , in the deserts of North Africa , people turned to moonlight festivals with sacred dances and music held for hours , until dawn .
these festivals were always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but back and forth , very rarely , something special happened , one of the actors actually became superworldly .
and I know that you know what I mean , because I know that you all know that you &apos;re already in your life , and you &apos;ve seen this kind of performance .
it was as if the time was standing still and the dancer was going through a kind of gate , he did nothing but he ever did it before . &quot; &#91; 1,000 nights earlier , but everything added up together . &#93;
and suddenly , he didn &apos;t appear any longer purely human .
he was taken from within and illuminated from below , and everything illuminated himself through a light of God .
when this was the case , the people knew what that was , they called it &quot; at its name . &quot;
they put their hands together and started to sing : &quot; Allah , Allah , God , God , God . &quot;
that is God . you know .
interesting historical footnote when the Ethiopian southern Spain conquered , they brought this custom with them : the debate changed over the course of the centuries from Allah , Allah , to Olé , Olé , Olé , which is still used in bullfights and Flamenco dances .
if a performer in Spain could find something impossible , something magical , Allah Olé Olé Allah , great Bravo , incomprehensible , there it is a volatile look at God .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
but the tricky part follows the next morning , when the dancer himself wakes up and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a Tuesday . and he &apos;s no longer a little five @-@ fold from God in himself .
he &apos;s just an aging mortal with painful knees and maybe he &apos;s going to never again become these heights .
and maybe never again will anyone be able to call God &apos;s name when it turns , but what should he do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
that &apos;s one of the most painful corrections to a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of pain if you &apos;re going to be unbelieving from the beginning that the most extraordinary aspects of your life would come from you .
if you might just believe that you have a loan from the agency , from an unimaginable source for a fine time of your life that is connected to someone else , if you &apos;re done with it .
if we start to think about it , it changes all .
so I started to think and think , so I think , certainly , in the past few months , while I &apos;m thinking of the book that &apos;s going to be published soon , when the dangerous , frightening , much @-@ awaited successor of my departed success .
what I &apos;m constantly saying to myself when I talk about it crazy is , &quot; Don &apos;t be afraid .
don &apos;t be discouraged , just do your job .
be still responsible for your contribution , as whatever he is , whatever .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the stupid divine genius , the genius that is standing by you , decides for a short moment to have a touch of miracles through your effort to show you , then Olé .
and if not , dance your dance .
and Olé : for you , despite all this .
I believe that , and I have the feeling that we should teach that .
Olé : for you , despite all this , just for you to be the mere human love and attachment there , to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
June Cohen Olé
you know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about human genome , and what the meaning is , and about the human discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point , and we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to move from digital code to a new phase of biology , by creating new life and building new life .
we have always tried to answer important questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something I think is that many biologists are trying to do to understand and understand that on different levels .
we have different approaches to make it possible , except for the minimum components , to simplify it .
we have nearly 20 years of digitization when we &apos;ve sequenced the human genome , and the change from the analogue to the analog world of biology to the digital world , the computer , was going to be .
now we &apos;re trying to ask if we &apos;re able to regenerate life , or if we &apos;re able to create new life from this digital universe .
that &apos;s the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma geitalium , which is the smallest genome in a species that has itself in the lab replicated , and we &apos;ve tried to see if we could do this with an even smaller genome .
we have managed to get to about one hundred genes out of the 500 or so genes , which are here .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to what we trust , you tell me , that &apos;s simple , but if we all look at these genes that we have one after the other eliminated , it &apos;s simple , it &apos;s very unlikely that this will lead to a living cell .
so we have decided that it will be the only way to move forward , this chromosome , actually , synthesize what we can do , which allows us to vary the individual components , and so we can ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started to talk to the question , &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
allows the chemistry to really make these really big molecules , which is never before done before .
and if we can do that , we can start the chromosome .
a chromosome is , by the way , just a piece of inert chemical material .
our steps in digitization of life and our steps were exponential .
our ability to use genetic code has changed a lot slowly . but still , it has increased , and our last point would now be an exponential curve .
we have 15 years ago started with it .
it actually took a few years , starting with a bioethical review , before we started the first experiments .
how it turned out , DNA synthesization is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that are small pieces of DNA that can make 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a degenerative process , so the longer you make a piece , the more errors happen .
so we had to use a new method to develop this new little piece of stuff , and we had to correct the mistakes .
that was our first attempt , starting with the digital information of the genome Phi X 174 .
it &apos;s a small virus that can kill bacteria .
we created small pieces , made a bug correction , and we had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we saw this piece of inert chemistry and we went into a bacterium and we got the bacterium started to use genetic code to read and make viral particles .
the viral particles were then removed from the cells and came to the back and killed E. coli .
recently , I started working with the oil industry , and they said that they were going to understand this model .
they laughed more than they were here . &quot; so we think we think that this is a situation where software is actually the software &apos;s own hardware that can build , in a biological system .
but we wanted to go a lot further , we wanted to have a whole bacterial chromosome built , it has more than 580,000 letters of genetic code . so we thought we &apos;re building it in cassettes of the size of the virus , which is what we &apos;re going to vary the size of the cassettes to understand what the individual components of a living cell are .
design is the key , and if you &apos;re using digital information in the computer , you have to start this digital information really flawlessly .
when we saw the genome sequenced for the first time in 1995 , the error rate was 10 000 pairs of bases .
we found a 30 error when resequencing , if we were to use the original sequence , it would never have been possible to go up .
part of the design is to make pieces . 50 pieces that contain 50 letters long and the ones that are 50 letters overlap pieces to create smaller sub @-@ units . so that they fit together .
we have unique elements built in here .
you may have heard that we &apos;re installing watermarks .
think about it . we have a 4 @-@ letter code A , C , G and T .
triplets of these letters , these letters encode about 20 amino acids , and here &apos;s a single determination for each of these amino acids .
so we can actually use the genetic code to translate our words into phrases , thoughts .
at first we only signed .
some people were disappointed that there was no poetry .
we have the pieces constructed in such a way that we can easily break them down with enzymes , and there are enzymes that repair and reintegrate them .
and we started to play pieces . starting with pieces that were five to seven thousand letters , we added these pieces to each other to make 24,000 letters pieces to make them rejoin them , up to 72 000 .
in every step , we have these pieces in surplus , so that we can sequence them , because we tried to make a very robust process , which they did in a minute , and we &apos;ll see .
we tried to get to the point of automation .
so that looks like a basketball playoff .
if we go to these really big pieces , with over 100 000 base pairs , then these are not just going to be growing in E.coli , it &apos;s going to exceed all the possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we turned to other mechanisms .
we knew of a mechanism that the homologist called recombination , called the biology that biology uses to make DNA repair that could repair those pieces that could fit together .
here &apos;s an example of this : there &apos;s an organism called Deinococcus radiodurans , which has three million wheel of radiation .
you see , in the upper field , that his chromosome just falls apart .
12 to 24 hours later , the whole thing has been assembled together again as it was .
we have thousands of organisms doing this , and we have thousands of organisms .
these organisms can be totally dried up , and they can even live in vacuum .
I am absolutely sure that life in space exists and that life is moving , on the quest for aquatic conditions , in search of .
in fact , NASA has shown that there &apos;s a lot of of it out there .
here &apos;s a picture of the molecule that we &apos;re producing . by doing this process , we &apos;ve actually actually got this process , we &apos;ve only used yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces , we &apos;ve adapted them . yeast then automatically adds them together .
that &apos;s not an electron microscope , it &apos;s a regular microscope image .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even do it with the light microscope .
these are recordings of a duration of 6 seconds .
that &apos;s the publication we &apos;re only recently finalising .
these are over 580,000 letters to the genetic code , it &apos;s the largest molecule with a defined structure , which ever has been created by humans .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
if we deal with a font size of 10 and without spacing , we would have to print 142 pages , just to print this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s a virus that &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s a lot more complicated with bacteria .
it is also easier to do it in eukaryotes , as we do . if you do , you just take the nucleus out and give it another one in , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;re all talking about cloning .
in archaebacteria , the chromosome is integrated into the cell , but it &apos;s just recently that we &apos;ve shown that you can actually see a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another , and you can activate it .
we cleaned the chromosome of a microbial species . roughly speaking , these two are as far from each other as humans and mice . we gave some extra genes to make us choose this chromosome , we decomposed it with enzymes to destroy all proteins and destroy it , and it was very amazing when we put it in a cell , and they &apos;re going to be our very mature graphics here .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that the end is here , but we tried to make the process a little bit further .
that &apos;s the main mechanism of evolution here .
we find all kinds of species here , which are a second chromosome that has been taken up , or a third of where every time thousands of characteristics are recorded in just one second , adding to a species .
so people who are imagining evolution as a gene that &apos;s going to be changed at a time have a lot of biology missed .
there are enzymes that are called restrictive enzymes that actually digest DNA .
the chromosome that is in the cell has no one , the chromosomes that we inserted , has already .
it was built in the cell and realized that the other chromosome was a foreign material , digested it , and so we had at the end only one cell with a new chromosome .
it turned blue because of the genes that we inserted .
and after a very short time , it had all the characteristics of the species lost and completely converted into a new species based on the species , based on the new software that we gave into the cell .
all proteins changed , the membranes changed , changed when we saw the genetic code , it was exactly that , what we transferred was .
it may seem like genomic alchemy , but we can do it by using the software DNA to move things quite dramatically .
now I have argued that this is not Genesis , the Genesis , which is based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and I &apos;ve argued that we might be doing this , and we &apos;re going to have a new kind of Cambrian explosion that is going to create massive new species formation based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we &apos;re going to need .
we are in the process of being six and a half to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to get it in my context , I was born in the year 1946 .
today , three people are on this planet for everyone who &apos;s been living in 1946 , within a 40 @-@ year period , four will be there .
we have problems with food , fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6.5 billion dollars people .
it will be a challenge to do this for 9 .
we need more than five billion tons of coal , 30 @-@ plus billion barrels of oil , which is a hundred million barrels a day .
if we talk about biological processes or any process to get the process replaced , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
then of course , there &apos;s all the CO2 from this material that &apos;s in the atmosphere .
we now have a look at the world of our discoveries , a database of about 20 million genes and I think I want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
the electronics industry had a dozen components and you can see the diversity of the things that came about .
we are encountering this first and foremost in the borders of biological reality and in those of our ideas .
we have technologies today because of this fast synthesis method to make this happen , which we can call combinatorial genetics .
we now have the opportunity to have a big robot built that can take millions of chromosomes a day , and we can do it .
if you imagine this 20 million dollar difference in gene production , or if you want to optimize these processes to make octane , or if you want to make drugs , new vaccines , we can change molecular biology with a small team , just a little bit more than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just male selection . we can look for viability , we can select chemicals or fuel production , vaccine production , and so on .
that &apos;s a recording of real design software on which we work , with which you can actually sit down and create new species on the computer , you know .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like , we know exactly what their genetic code will look like .
we focus now on fuel from the fourth generation .
you have recently seen corn grow into ethanol , which is just a bad experiment .
we have been using second and third generation fuels , which are coming out relatively soon , which will have much higher sugar @-@ making activities , like octane or different types of butanol .
but as we think , the only way we can do this is to make biology have a big impact without further increasing food costs or limiting their availability . if you have biology , if you think we see CO2 as the raw material , and so we &apos;re working on cells that go that way .
and we think that we &apos;re going to start using the fourth generation of fuels , and we &apos;re going to be about 18 months .
sunlight and CO2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we &apos;ve all seen different methods .
that &apos;s an organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about one and a half miles deep , at almost boiling water temperatures .
it converts CO2 into methane , under the use of hydrogen , as an energy source .
we investigate whether we can use stored CO2 , which is easy to produce places . converts to the CO2 in the fuel to convert this process to drive it .
within a short period of time , we believe that we can be able to build one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really have moderate targets like replacing the new system of petrochemical industry , exactly when you don &apos;t do this at TED , where else would be a major source of energy ?
but just as we &apos;re working on doing the same thing at the moment to develop vaccines .
you have it this year with the flu , we &apos;re here , we &apos;re always one year behind , and we &apos;ve got a dollar too little when it comes to the right vaccine .
I think that this will be changed by changing recombinant vaccines .
that &apos;s how the future might be . with the changes that can be made today , the evolutionary tree can be accelerated , with synthetic bacteria , archaea , and possibly eukaryotes .
we are light years away from getting people better , and our goal is to just make us have a chance to have a long enough chance to survive , to possibly do that . thank you .
what I &apos;m going to tell you first as quickly as possible is the basic work , a new technology that we need to use Microsoft as part of a takeover just a year ago , which is Seadragon .
and it &apos;s an environment where people can either eat locally or away with huge amounts of food and visual data , and they can do it .
we see many , many gigabytes of digital photos here , which you can seamlessly and continuously get up to , swivel in any way you can rearrange .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at , how big these collections are , or how big the images are .
most of them are digital photos of a camera , but this one is about , for example , a scan of the Congress Library , and it &apos;s in an area of 300 megapixels .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that makes the performance of a system like this can limit is the number of pixels on your screen in .
every moment , it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of non @-@ image data .
that &apos;s Bleak House of Dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove that there is really a question of a text and not a text , not a picture , we can do something like that , to really show that it &apos;s a real representation of the text and not an image , and we can do something like that .
maybe this is an artificial way of writing an e @-@ book .
I would not recommend it .
this is a more realistic case , and this is an output of The Guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a section .
and that gives them really the pleasure and the good experience of having a real paper edition of a magazine or a newspaper to read what &apos;s in itself a kind of medium with several orders of magnitude .
we also have something to do at the corner of this special edition of The Guardian .
we have a false message with very high resolution , which we have drafted much higher than in a normal ad , and we have additional information about it .
if you want to use the features of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and this really does take up these ideas , these restrictions on the space available on the screen , to abolish .
we hope that this will not be pop @-@ ups and other nonsense anymore , and that should not be necessary .
of course , mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and I want to really not do much time here , except to say that we also have to go to this area .
but these are all streets in the U @-@ S , A.
upstairs , on the ground @-@ floor image of NASA .
let us now have something else to pick up .
that &apos;s even live now on the Internet . you can check it out .
this is a project that &apos;s called Photosynth , which really has two different technologies that connect .
one is Seadragon and the other is Seadragon , and the other is a very good research on computer vision that is done by Noah Snavely , a university student at Washington University , under Steve Seitz &apos;s advice at UW .
and Rick Szeliski from Microsoft , research was carried out a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the Internet , it &apos;s powered by Seadragon .
you can see that when we see this kind of view created , where we &apos;re going to pass through images , and this experience of multiple resolution , we can do this .
but the spatial arrangement of the images is here in fact in the meaning .
the computer vision algorithms have captured these images together so that they can give the real space in which these recordings , all of which are located near Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies , correspond to the real space in which they were made . you see elements of stabilized slides or panoramic image processing , and these things were all spatially related to each other .
I don &apos;t know exactly if I still have time to give you other environments .
there are those who have much more spatial space .
I would like to make a straight one of the original records of Noah , and that &apos;s from an early prototype of photosynth , where we first started to work in the summer to give you that to show you what I think it really is that it &apos;s the point behind this technology of photosynth technology , and this is not necessarily so obvious when you look at the environments that we &apos;re looking at on the website .
we had to look at the lawyers , etc .
this is a reconstruction of Notre Cathedral . Dame , which is built exclusively in computer .
with pictures by Flickr , they give you just Notre Dame in Flickr , and they put you pictures of men in Flickr T @-@ shirts and on the university grounds , etc .
get each of these orange cone represents an image that is seen as being belonging to this model .
so this is all Flickr images , and they &apos;re all spatially on this way , in this way , in relation to each other .
and we can &apos;t wait for this very simple way .
you know , I never believed that I would eventually be working at Microsoft .
I am very grateful for the welcome here .
I guess you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras , everything is about it from the cell phone camera to professional SLRs , a pretty large number of them all in this environment , all of them flicked together .
and if possible , I &apos;ll get some of the strange ones , many of them are covered with faces , etc .
somewhere here are a number of photographs here , and they &apos;re .
this is actually a poster of Notre Dame , which is recorded correctly .
we can expect the poster to be a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we &apos;re doing things with the social environment . it &apos;s going to be data from all of you .
from the entire collective memory , how visually the Earth looks like , and everything is going to be connected .
all these photos are connected to each other , and there &apos;s something bigger than the one that &apos;s the sum of the parts .
you will receive a model that comes from all over the world .
look at this as the continuation of the work of Stephen Lawler on Virtual Earth .
and that &apos;s something that &apos;s going to be done by the complexity that people use it , and it &apos;s growing and its benefits for the user with the application are getting bigger and bigger .
your own photos are taken with metadata that shows a different person entering another person .
if someone wants to make the effort and to get all these saints labeled and communicated , who they all are , then the way I take my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral suddenly becomes familiar with all these data , and I can see them as the starting point to go to this room , dive into this metaverse , take the photos of other people , and so I can use some kind of cross @-@ modal social experience with the use of other providers .
and of course by @-@ product , all of this is the immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the world that are not only superfluous or satellite images , and so on , but also collective memory .
thank you .
Chris Anderson : I understand you right . your software allows you to get a certain time within the next few years , all the images that someone in the world has used together in principle , basically , to be connected .
Baa : yes , she does nothing but discover when you want created it . hyperlinks between the pictures .
and she does this because of the content in the pictures .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you &apos;re going to see the abundance of semantic information that many of these images have .
how if you want to find a web search for images where you enter sentences and the text of the website contains a lot of information about what image that is ?
but how about it if the picture you were using with all your pictures ?
then the scope of semantic cross @-@ connection and abundance , which is derived from it , is really .
huge , it &apos;s a classic network effect .
ca Blaise : that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations , Baa . have you . thank you very much .
you know , one of the big neglect when traveling , and one of the joys of ethnographic research is , together with people , to live together , who are still interested in the old days , who can remember their past , which are still feeling the wind , they &apos;re on rocks smoothed by the rain , they &apos;re touching the bitter leaves of the plants .
just know that Jaguar shamans are still beyond the Milky Way , or that the meaning of myths , the elders of Inuit , is still of great importance , or that in the Himalayas , Buddhists are still breathing the Dharma breath . is it the Dharma &apos;s central revelation of anthropology in memory that means calling the mind ? that &apos;s the thought that the world is in which we live , not in an absolute sense , but only as an absolute
as a result of a group of certain possibilities of adaptation , which our ancestors , although successful many generations ago , chose .
and of course , we all share the same adaptive needs .
we will all be born , we bring children to the world .
we go through initiation rituals .
we must deal with the unstoppable separation by the death of the child , and so it should not surprise us that we all sing , dance and dance and bring forth art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique tone of the song , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
and it doesn &apos;t matter if it &apos;s a matter of the Penan in the forests of Borneo , or whether it &apos;s the voodoo acolytes in Haiti , or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of northern Kenya , the Curanderos in the Andes , or a caravan factory in the middle of the Sahara , this is by chance the colleague I met a month ago in the desert , or even a Yak shepherd on the slopes of Qomolang@@
Everest , the Mother of God of the World
all these people teach us that it &apos;s still other ways of life , other ways of thinking , other ways of orientating ourselves on Earth .
and that &apos;s an idea that , if you think about it , you can only fill it with hope .
together , the countless cultures of the world form a network of spiritual and cultural life that is the encircled earth and is responsible for the good of the earth , as important as the biological network of life that is known as the biosphere .
you can &apos;t imagine this cultural network of life as an ethnosphere , and ethnosphere can be seen as the total sum of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations , and intuitions that have been influenced by human imagination since the beginning of consciousness .
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
it is the symbol of all that we are and what we want to see as amazing , curious species .
and just like the biosphere is strongly removed , this happened with the ethnosphere , only with the even greater speed .
no biologist would , for example , dare to claim that 50 or more of all kinds are just before extinction , because it &apos;s simply not true , and yet this is the most apocalyptic scenario on the field of biodiversity . hardly any of what is happening to us as the most optimistic scenario in the field of cultural diversity is known .
and the decisive indicator is that the extinction of languages .
when each of them in this room was born , the children of the Earth were given 6000 languages .
now , a language is not just the whole of vocabulary or a series of grammar rules .
a language is an expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means of making the soul of a particular culture accessible to the material world , and it &apos;s a means of making it happen .
every language is like an old forest of spirit , a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and of these 6000 languages , today , while we &apos;re here in Monterey , we &apos;re sitting here , half of them are no longer in the ears of kids .
they &apos;re not going to teach toddlers any more , that is , if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be more lonely than the silence enveloping you ? a man of the last of your people to be your language speaking , no possibility to have the wisdom of the ancestors passed on , or hope to be children ,
and yet this terrible fate is actually happening to someone somewhere on Earth , about two or so weeks , because of every two weeks , an older person dies and takes the last syllables of an old language with him into the tomb .
and I know that some of you say , &quot; Is it not better ? &quot; so the world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we all had one language to speak , and I say , &quot; Well , let this language be Yoruba . &quot; let it be cantonal .
let Kogi be .
and then they would suddenly see how it would be if they could have their own language not spoken .
I would therefore like to draw your attention today to a journey through the ethnosphere , a short journey through the ethnosphere around it , trying to make you understand what the real loss actually has been .
now there are some of us who are , in a sense , forgotten that when I say , I really have different ways of being , different ways of being , my ways of being .
take to the place , for example , this child , the Barasana , in the northwest of the Amazon . the Anaklona people believe that they mythologically believe that the flow of milk from the east came up in the belly of holy snakes .
that &apos;s a people who don &apos;t cognitively distinguish between the colors blue and green , because the sky tent is similar to the forest that people depend on , and that &apos;s what people call the sky tent .
you have a strange language and a marriage rule , linguistic exogamy , called linguistic exogamy , you have to marry someone who has another language .
all of this is rooted in the mythological past , the peculiarity of these great houses , where , due to mixed marriages , six or seven languages are spoken , is that you never hear someone who has a language .
you only listen and start to hear , and then talk .
or one of the most fascinating tribes that I &apos;ve ever lived with , the Waorani , in the northeast of Ecuador , an amazing people that first came to contact peacefully in 1958 .
in 1957 , five missionaries tried to get in touch and made a serious mistake .
they threw shiny photos of themselves . what they did was they threw them down from the air , which we would rate as a kind gesture , and they forgot that these people from the rainforest in their lives had never seen anything two @-@ dimensional .
they raised these photographs from the forest floor , tried to get behind the face or figure , found nothing and found conclusion that this was business cards of the devil and killed the five missionaries with the five spear .
but the Waorani didn &apos;t just kill outsiders with the spear .
they drilled each other .
54 % of deaths were caused by drillings .
we followed geneaology eight generations back , and we found two cases of a natural death and when we saw people , with emphasis , say something about it , they gave us that one of the people , who had grown so old that he was so old that he died because of his age , and we killed him anyway with the spear , but at the same time they had a clear knowledge of the forest that was amazing .
your hunters could not see the urine of an animal 40 steps away and determine how to smell and determine the animal species it belonged to .
in the early 1980s , I got a really amazing job . when I was taught by my professor at Harvard , I asked myself if I was interested in going to Haiti and to see secret societies infiltrate the secret societies that were the foundation of duvalier &apos;s strength and tone , Macoutes , and the poison that used to get used to zombies . to make sure .
to make this sensation sense , I had to , of course , learn something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun , and Voodoo is not a cult of black magic .
on the contrary , it is a complex metaphysical worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if I ask you , the big world religions would list , &quot; What would you say ? &quot;
Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , Judaism or whatever .
a continent is always left out , because the presumption was that it was not religious in black Africa . of course , there was one and Voodoo is just the remnant of this very profound religious thought , which was during the tragic diaspora of the slavery era .
but what Voodoo is so interesting is this living relationship between the two living and the living and the dead .
the living give birth to the spirits .
the spirits can be heard from under the great water . answers to the rhythm of the dance to the soul . to save the soul of the living temporarily , so that the acolyth is for a short , shining moment to God .
Deshab : &quot; the voodooists like to say , &quot; Your white ones go to church and talk about God . &quot;
we dance in the temple and become God .
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to be taken by the Spirit . how can you be hurt ?
see these amazing demonstrations , voodoo @-@ acolyths , in a trance state , the glowing coal without burning , grabbing an amazing illustration of the ability of the mind to influence the body in such a way that it can endure it when it enters a state of extreme arousal .
now , of all the people I &apos;ve met , the Kogi were from Sierra Nevada , de Santa Marta , in northern Colombia , the most extraordinary .
descendants of the ancient tyrannical civilization that the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia populated and subsequently became part of the conquest , this people settled in a isolated volcanic massif , isolated from the surface of the Caribbean coast .
in a bloodstained continent , these people were the only people who never had been conquered by the Spaniards .
until today , the Commission is still working on a ritual priesthood that will allow formation as a priesthood , but it is very extraordinary .
the young acolyths are born at the age of three and four by their families , separated from them and buried in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the foot of the glaciers for 18 years . two periods of nine years each deliberately chosen to reconstruct the nine months of pregnancy , which is what they had in their womb , their mother &apos;s womb , now they spend metamorphically in the womb of the great mother .
and during all this time , they &apos;re culturally integrated into the values of their society , values that underline the claim that their prayers and prayers are only their prayers , the cosmic or we could say that the ecological balance is maintained .
at the end of this amazing initiation , you will suddenly be going to take one day out and for the first time in your life , at the age of 18 , you will see a sunrise , and in this crystal clear moment of consciousness , the first light , when the sun starts to climb onto the slopes of the amazingly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything you see learned in abstract becomes amazing splendor , confirmed and the priest steps up and down .
and says , &quot; Look , you know , it &apos;s really like I told you .
it &apos;s so wonderful , you have to protect it .
they call themselves the older brothers and say that we are the ones we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world , we are responsible .
well , this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we think about natives and landscapes , we conjure up either Rousseau and the old town rumour of noble wild animals . what is in its simplification a racist thought , is it ? or Thoreau and say , &quot; These people are more with nature than they are with us . &quot;
so natives are neither sentimental nor will they be taken by nostalgia .
it is not much space for it to be found in the malaria @-@ contaminated swamps of Asmat or the cold winds of Tibet . however , they have nevertheless a long and ritual mystery of the Earth &apos;s Nimbus , which is not based on the idea of consciously being close to her , but on a far more subtle intuition of the idea that the Earth itself exists only because it exists in the human consciousness , inhales it .
well , what does that mean ?
it means that a little child from the Andes is going to be the one who grows up in the belief that the mountain is an APU spirit that determines his or her destiny , a completely different person , and another relationship with this resource or resource or place will have a different relationship than a little child from Montana , who in faith grows up to be a mountain , a pile of stones that can be removed .
whether he is a abode of a spirit or a pile of brass is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that makes the relationship between the individual and nature defined , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about .
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia and I believed that these forests would make it there . I rode to the forest .
that made me a different person , than my friends , among the Kwakiutl , who believe that these forests are the whereabouts of Hukuk and Hukuk and the curved beak of heaven and cannibal spirits , the ones that are at the northern end of the world , spirits that they participate in their Hamatsa initiation .
now , when you start to understand the idea that these cultures are different realities , they can create some of their extraordinary discoveries , for example , these plants here , you know .
it &apos;s a photo I took just last April in the northwest of the Amazon .
this is ayahuasca from which many of you belong . that &apos;s the strongest psychoactive preparation from the repertoire of the shaman .
what ayahuasca is so fascinating is not only the pharmacological potential of this preparation , but also the processing of it . it &apos;s really made up of two different sources : on the one hand , there &apos;s this wooden liane that has a number of beta @-@ carbolines , harmine , harmolin , slightly hallucinogen , which is just to take this climbing plant , is about as if a blue turmoil smoke is on its consciousness , but it &apos;s going to
with the name Psychotria viridis mixed .
this plant contains some very strong tryptamins that are similar to serotonin , dimethyltryptamin @-@ 5 and methoxydimethyltryptamine .
if you have ever seen the Yanomami , how you can see this stuff snuff , this substance that you can get from different kinds of stuff , also contains Methoxydimethyltryptamine .
this powder to snuff is about the same as from a gun run shot at , lined by baroque paintings and paintings , and landing on a sea of electricity . it &apos;s not going to distort reality , but rather to dissolve the reality .
I even talked to my professor Richard Evan Shultes , the man who was the psychedelic Area with the discovery of the magical mushrooms in Mexico . in the 1930s , I started the discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico . I said that you didn &apos;t classify these tryptamins as hallucinogen , because at the moment you saw the effects , you couldn &apos;t feel there anymore , you &apos;re there to experience a hallucination , but the
because they are replaced by a human gut naturally occurring enzyme with a name called monoamine oxidase .
you can only use the following links with some other chemicals orally : the substances that the Mao denaturate .
well , the fascinating thing is that the beta @-@ carbolins that are contained in the liane , the Mao inhibitors , are exactly the kind of thing that &apos;s necessary to potenate the tryptamins . so , ask yourself .
how can these people come from a flora of 80,000 species ? astringent plants , these two morphologically not related plants , find the two that , if this combined , can be a kind of biochemical version , so that the whole thing is larger than the sum of its parts .
we use this great euphemism , try and mistake , which is insignificant .
but if you ask the Indians , &quot; Say , &quot; The plant is talking to us .
so what does that mean ?
this tribe , the Cofan , have 17 variants of ayahuasca that they all have at great distance in the forest , which are for our eyes considered to be a kind of thing .
and then you ask them how they can change their taxonomy , and they say , &quot; I thought you understand something about plants .
I mean , you know , nothing at all , and I said , &quot; No .
so it turns out that you can see each of the 17 variants on full moon , and they sing to a single in different pitches , and you can see that .
well , that doesn &apos;t give you a PhD in Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting to count than Stamina , now the problem is that even those who are among us who have sympathy for the difficult situation of the natives , they &apos;re considered orginian and colorful , they &apos;re somehow looking at the past , but they &apos;re somehow limiting the real world , that is , our world , progressing .
so the fact is that you &apos;re going to look at the 20th century in 300 years , not for its wars or technical innovations , but rather for its wars or technical innovations , but rather for an era in which we were present , and the massive destruction of biodiversity and cultural diversity on Earth , either actively supported or passively accepted , so the problem is not change .
all cultures have always been interested in the dance with new ideas for life .
and the problem is not technology , technology itself .
the Sioux Indians heard no less Sioux . Sioux was the first to hear them bow and arrow tasks than the Americans stopped doing . Americans were the horses and horse cars they were doing .
not change and technology threaten integrity . it &apos;s not the ethnosphere , it &apos;s power to change the ugly face of domination .
and where ever you can get into the world , you can see , you &apos;ll discover that these cultures don &apos;t go down , they &apos;re dynamic living peoples whose lives are being made visible by recognizable forces that are being pushed out of their capacity to adapt , whether it &apos;s about the tremendous deforestation , in their home country , the Penan , a nomadic people from Southeast Asia , Sarawak , a people who were free a generation ago in the forest .
and now to bondage and prostitution on the riverbank was humiliated by where they see that they can see that even the river with the mud is polluted , which is almost half Borneo into the South China Sea seems to float away from where the Japanese freighter is floating on the horizon , ready to see their ship &apos;s rooms with raw tree trunks that they can fill with the forest or have taken away , as in the case of the Yanomami .
where it &apos;s disease carriers who are killed during the gold rush .
or if we go up into the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m looking for a lot of stuff , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the physical extinction of people , is generally condemned , but the ethnocide , the destruction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not condemned , but generally and widely regarded as part of a development strategy .
and you can &apos;t see Tibet &apos;s suffering if you don &apos;t understand it at the lowest level .
I traveled with a young colleague , 6000 miles from Chengdu , in Western China , overseas through Southeast Tibet , to Lhasa , and only when I came to Lhasa , I saw the face behind the statistics , which you hear 6000 saints , monuments that were buried in debris and ashes , and 1.2 miles from people who were killed during the Cultural Revolution by the cadres , and I saw them .
the Father of this young man was called a follower of the Panchen Lama .
that meant that he was killed during the Chinese invasion immediately .
his uncle fled with her holiness in the Diaspora , people who were going to Nepal .
his mother was imprisoned as punishment for the persecution of the crime , to be wealthy .
he was born at the age of two in prison , smuggled to get under her feet of rock . because she was not able to hide without him .
the sister who had done this brave act was taken to an educational camp .
one day she stepped out of the box accidentally on a Maos bracelet , and for this violation she had to be in a heavy labour camp for seven years .
suffering of Tibet can be unbearable , but the redeeming spirit of people is something unforgettable .
and in the end , we &apos;re really facing an election , and if we want to be in a monochromatic world of monotony , or in a polychromatic world of diversity .
Margaret Mead : the great anthropologist said before she died that it was her greatest fear , that during the time we were heading towards a thread of uncreative generic worldview , we didn &apos;t just move the entire spectrum of human imagination to a narrowed way of thinking , we would not only see the whole spectrum of human imagination reduced , but that one day we would wake up from a dream and forget that there were ever other possibilities .
and it &apos;s humiliating to think about the fact that our genus , maybe since 600,000 years , exists .
the Neolithic Revolution , which has brought agriculture to us and has brought us to worship at this moment in the seed grain , the shaman &apos;s poetry , through the prose of the priesthood , replaced hierarchy , specialization , and surplus , found only 10,000 years ago .
modern industrial world , as we see it , is barely 300 years old .
well , this superficial story doesn &apos;t tell me that we &apos;re all responding to the challenges that we &apos;re facing in the next millennia , and we &apos;re going to have to face .
if we look at these countless world cultures according to the meaning of humanity , they answer 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we will have the opportunity to rediscover that we &apos;re what we &apos;re , people with full consciousness who are aware of the importance of giving everyone the opportunity to see a space that thrives in all people and gardens , and it &apos;s great moments of the optimism .
here &apos;s a photo that I took on the northern end of the Baffin Islands when I was traveling with Inuits to the Narwhal hunt , and this man , Olaya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the Canadian government is not always very good at dealing with the Inuit , and during the 1950s , in the course of establishing our rule , we have forced them to move to settlements .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all the weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the Inuit is not afraid of the cold , they used it to their advantage .
the sliding rails of their sled were originally made of fish , wrapped in caricature skin .
the grandfather of the man was not afraid of the Arctic night or the blowing storm .
he slipped out , let his pants out of seal fur down , and threw them in his hand , and when the feces started to freeze , he formed them into the shape of a knife .
he sprayed saliva on the sides of the sewage knife , and when it was completely frozen , he struck a dog with it .
he skinned the dog and improvised a tableware , took the skeleton of the dog , and improvised a sledge , stretched another dog on , and vanished over the ice floes with the fecal knife on the belt .
so you can &apos;t get anything done and do anything , and this is in many ways a symbol of resistance from the Inuit and all the natives on earth .
the Canadian government gave the Inuit a new mandate in April 1999 to fully control an area . it is larger than California , and Texas , together .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called Nunavut .
it &apos;s an independent area . you control all mineral deposits .
an amazing example of how a nation , a state , can make reparation with its inhabitants and reach them .
and ultimately , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are going to be at these distant goals of the Earth , to realize that they &apos;re not at all distant .
you are the home countries of someone .
they represent parts of human imagination that are in past times , and that are for all of us , dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , are part of the geography of hope .
what we do at National Geographic ultimately try is that we believe that politicians never have anything to achieve .
we believe that polemics , we believe that polemics are not convincing , but we believe that storytelling is the world that can change , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in history , in the world . our website receives 35 million hits every month .
156 nations send our TV channel .
our magazines are being read by millions .
and we &apos;re doing a number of trips to the ethnosphere , where we &apos;re going to see our audience in places of such cultural wonders that they &apos;re going to be blinded by what we see , and hopefully they &apos;re going to be one by one , the central revelation of anthropology , that this world has earned it in different ways to exist , that we have a way of life in a truly multicultural , pluralistic world .
and when wisdom is of all men , to our common well @-@ being , can contribute .
thank you .
I &apos;m going to give you some things out of my book that deal with other things that you &apos;ve heard of , and try to make connections if you don &apos;t notice them .
I would like to start with what I am calling official dogma .
the official dogma of what ?
the official belief of all Western industrial societies .
the official dogma is : if our goal is to maximize the welfare of our citizens , we will do so above all through maximizing the maximum freedom of individuals .
the reason for this is that freedom is at and for itself valuable , meaningful and essential for the human being .
if people have freedom , everyone acts as a self @-@ employed person to do things . they do things that maximize our common good , and nobody has to decide for us .
the Way to Maximize Freedom is to choose to maximize choices .
the more choices people have , the more freedom , and the more freedom they have , the more common good they have .
this is , I think , so deep rooted in us that there is no one in the sense of getting it questioned .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
I &apos;ll give you some examples of what modern progress allows us to do .
this is my supermarket , not a big one .
just a short while to salad dressings .
there are 175 dressings in my supermarket when you have the 10 different native olive oils not counting and 12 balsamic vinegar varieties that you could buy to buy to a large number of your own salad dessings , in which unlikely , in the unlikely case , you don &apos;t like any of the 175 in the store .
so this is how the supermarket works .
then go to a electronics store to buy a stereo system , put together speakers , CD players , cassette recorders , radio amplifiers , and in this one electronics store , there are so many stereo systems .
we can &apos;t get 6.5 million different stereo systems , from the components that are used in this business .
you have to admit that this is a great selection .
in other areas , the world of communication .
there was a time when I was a boy , and there was every telephone service that you wanted to do as long as he came from Ma Bell .
you rented the phone and bought it not .
as a result , the phone was never broken .
these days are over .
we have now almost an infinite selection of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is the one in the middle MP3 player , nasal hair trimmer and crème @-@ brû<unk> flambierer .
and should you do that so far , not in your business , have you seen it ? be sure that you will soon .
it brings people to the shops , and it &apos;s going to ask this question .
do you know the answer to this question ?
the answer is no .
it is impossible to use a mobile phone that is not too much .
for other areas of life that are much more important than shopping , the same goes for the explosion of choices .
health care in the United States is not going to be the case any longer , because you go to the doctor , and he tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor and the doctor says to you , &quot; We could do a or b . &quot;
a : has these advantages and risks ?
B ) has these advantages and risks ? what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; Doctor , what should I do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; A has these advantages and risks , and B has those advantages and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; If you were me , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
and the doctor says , &quot; But I &apos;m not you .
the result is patient autonomy , which sounds like a good thing , but it shifts the load of responsibility for the human meeting . of decisions from someone who has something to know , namely from the doctor to someone who knows nothing and most likely is ill , and therefore not in the best condition , to decide , namely , the patient .
there is an enormous marketing for prescription drugs for people like the one you and me , what if you think , no sense because we don &apos;t make it because we can &apos;t buy it .
why do you advertise us if we don &apos;t buy ?
because they expect us to tell the doctor closest morning , we &apos;ll call and make a change to the prescription .
something so profound as our identity is now a question of the choice of how this foil shows .
we don &apos;t inherit identity , we invent it .
and we invent ourselves so often anew as we want .
so , every day , when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , once the standard assumption was almost everyone had one and one married so quickly that they got so fast and so quickly children as one could .
the only true choice was who didn &apos;t , when and not what they did afterwards .
today , everything is easy to have .
I teach wonderfully intelligent students , and I give them 20 percent less work than before .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , or because they &apos;re less careful .
but because they &apos;re dealing with other things , they &apos;re asking themselves , &quot; Should I marry or not ? &quot; now .
or later , I &apos;m supposed to have kids , or I &apos;m going to make a career .
they &apos;re all engaging questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , even if they don &apos;t do their tasks and don &apos;t have a good grade in my course .
and you should do this in fact . that &apos;s important .
work : we are blessed , as Carl has pointed out , with the technology that allows us to do every minute , every day , from every place on the planet to the Randolph Hotel .
there are also a corner from the one I don &apos;t tell anybody about , where the WLAN works .
I don &apos;t say anything , because I want to use it .
this incredible freedom of choice in terms of work , decisions on making , re @-@ and @-@ making and re @-@ working , whether we should work or not .
we can help our children play football , watch with our mobile phone on one hip , and our BlackBerry on the other hip , and our laptop , probably on our lap .
and even if they all are switched off every minute in the world we give our child a chance to mutilate a football game , we also ask ourselves , &quot; Should I take this call ? &quot;
the email answers the letter .
and even if the answer to the question &quot; No &quot; is , it will change your experience from your child &apos;s football game , very differently than it would have been .
everywhere we look , big and small things , material things , and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world in which we lived saw so much .
this is what I want to say : there were some choices , but not everything was a matter of choice .
and the world in which we &apos;re now living sees it look like this .
and the question is , are the good or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so I &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
all these choices have two effects : two negative effects on people .
one effect paradoxically is that it &apos;s paralyzing instead of liberating .
with so many options from which you can choose , it falls to people very hard to get involved in deciding at all .
I &apos;m going to give you another drastic example of this : a study on investment in voluntary retirement provision .
a colleague of mine had access to investment files from Vanguard , the giant fund company of about one million employees , and about 2000 different jobs .
and what she found was , per 10 investment funds that the employer offered , the participation was increased by 2 percent .
they offer 50 investment funds , 10 percent fewer employees , participate than if they were just 5 percent offering , why ?
because it has 50 investment funds that are available to choose from , it &apos;s so hard to decide which to choose from , that they can choose to postpone it tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow , of course , never comes .
understand that the problem is not just that of human dog food , if you eat in the retirement , because you &apos;re not enough money to get back . it &apos;s meaning it &apos;s also making decisions , so hard to make them big investment offers of their employers .
the non @-@ participation gives you up to 5000 US $ per year on from the $ 5 million employer who has been happy to contribute to increasing .
paralysis is a consequence of too many choices .
and I think it &apos;s a matter of making the world look like this : you want to make the decision right when it comes to all eternity , right ?
you don &apos;t want to get the wrong investment fund , or even the wrong salad dressing ?
so that &apos;s one effect of the other effect , the other effect is that even if we overcome paralysis and have a decision , we end up less satisfied with the result of choosing than when we go beyond the possibility of having the opportunity to choose between fewer choices .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is conditioned by the great selection of different salad dressings . if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect and which salad dressing is already perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you &apos;re going to make a different decision .
even if there is a good decision .
the more opportunities there are , the easier it is to do nothing at all to regret - that &apos;s disappointing for the choice you make .
secondly , what economists call oppertunity costs .
Dan Gilbert has a big point today , this morning , by telling how much the world is going to do in which we evaluate things depends on what we &apos;re going to compare it .
well , if there are a lot of alternatives to consider , it &apos;s easy to imagine attractive properties , alternatives that you exclude , which makes you less satisfied with the way alternatives are available that you chose .
here &apos;s an example of the kind of things you don &apos;t know that are New York , and I apologize .
but here &apos;s what you think you should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple of the Hamptons .
very expensive properties .
beautiful beach , great day . you have it all for yourself .
what could be better , damn ?
the man thinks it &apos;s August . everyone in my neighborhood in Manhattan is gone .
I could go straight in front of my house .
and he spends 2 weeks from the thought pursued the one he had the opportunity to miss day by day a day a great parking lot to have .
oppertunity costs reduce satisfaction that we have achieved through our selection , even if what we do choose is fantastic .
and the more opportunities it can choose from , the more attractive properties of this selection will be in the oppertunity costs .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon makes some statements .
he makes a statement about it in the now living , and perhaps about it , things slowly doing .
but an important point he makes is that he &apos;s always who you &apos;re looking for a thing to decide on . you &apos;re not going to do other things , and these other things like many attractive properties , and it &apos;s going to be what you &apos;re going to do , making it less attractive .
thirdly , the escalation of expectations .
this has hit me when I saw my jeans exchange .
I wear jeans almost all the time .
and there was a time when there was only jeans , one kind of jeans , and they got them bought , and they got bad fit , they were incredibly uncomfortable and if they could keep them long enough , and often enough washed them , they did start to get OK , and they started to feel OK .
so I went to buy new jeans , and after many years of wearing the old and I said , I had liked to have a couple of jeans . here &apos;s my size .
and the seller said , &quot; Do you want to have slender , slightly lying , or wide ? &quot;
do you want to use buttons or zipper stone or acid washed ?
do you want to wear jeans with holes ?
do you want to cut down wide , tapered , blah , blah , blah , and so on ? he told .
my jaw was down , and after I recovered , I said , &quot; I &apos;d like to have the kind that used to be the only way .
he had no idea what that was , so I spent a hour doing it all , so all these damn jeans were trying out and drank the business , and I say the truth with the best jeans I ever had .
I had better to do all this selection , and I was better able to have it .
but I felt worse .
why I wrote a whole book to get to try to tell myself , and I &apos;m going to tell you ,
the reason why I was getting worse was that I was having all these available options , my expectations for what kind of good couple of jeans are , went up .
I had very low expectations , I had no concrete expectations when it came to meeting them only in a way .
when they were in 100 species , a woman of them would have been perfect .
and what I got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so I compared what I got . to what I got , to what I expected , and what I had , was disappointing compared to what I expected .
adding a range of possibilities to life of people increases inevitably the number of expectations people have . people have a lot to do about how good these opportunities will be .
and this leads to less satisfaction with the results , even though the results are good .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this .
because if you were to , you would not all know what it &apos;s all about .
the truth is more like this here .
the reason is that everything is better in the past than anything worse than anything worse than everything worse . was it worse for people to experience the things that a person would have been a pleasant surprise ?
nowadays , in the world where we live , we &apos;re living , wealthy industrialized citizens with perfection , expecting the best for you ever hope for . is that something that &apos;s so good as you &apos;re doing it from them ?
they will never be pleasantly surprised because their expectations , my expectations , are high .
the secret to happiness , that &apos;s what you all came for , the secret to happiness , are low expectations .
I would like to say a short autobiographical moment that I &apos;ve been married to a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
I would not have done better if I had not been able to settle down .
but settling down is not always such a bad thing .
ultimately , a consequence of buying a poorly seated jeans when it &apos;s just a kind of buying there is that there &apos;s that if you &apos;re dissatisfied and you &apos;re wondering why who &apos;s responsible for who &apos;s the answer is clear .
the world is responsible , what would you have done ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available and you &apos;re buying a one that disappointing is , and you &apos;re asking why , who &apos;s responsible ?
is it just as clear that the answer to the question is that you
they would have done better .
with 100 different types of jeans in the shop window , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so when people make decisions and make decisions , and even when the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about it . they accuse themselves .
clinical depression exploded in industrial world . in the last generation ,
I think a significant , not the only , but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression and also suicide , is that people experience that people who have been disappointing because their standards are so high that they &apos;re so high , and then when they have these experiences to explain themselves , think it would be their fault .
and so that &apos;s the balance sheet that we generally do better to be objective , and we feel worse .
so let me just remind you .
this is the official dogma that has one that we all believe is right , completely wrong , and it &apos;s not true .
there is no question of choosing something better . but there is no question of choice , but it doesn &apos;t follow . better choice than selecting something .
there is a magical amount . I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
I am pretty sure that we can do this for a long time , when we have chosen our common good to improve .
now , as a principle , I &apos;m almost finished as a principle question that matters , about the thinking about the matter , is what all of this selection allows in industrialized societies is that material is wealth .
there are many places in the world and we have heard about many of them . their problem is not the problem that is too wide a choice .
your problem is that you have too little .
so things about the things I &apos;m talking about are a weird problem of the modern rich Western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and annoying is Steve Levitt has a lot to tell you yesterday that these expensive and hard to fix child seats are not helping .
that &apos;s a waste of money .
I &apos;m telling you that these expensive , complicated decisions , it &apos;s not just that they &apos;re not helping .
they even hurt .
they ensure that we get worse because we &apos;re worse .
if some of what people in our society want to make choices in societies were postponed , in societies where people were not sufficiently selective , things didn &apos;t just improve life , people &apos;s lives , but our dignity also improved . economists call this a pareto @-@ improvement application .
income redistribution will ensure that all of us are better off , not just the poor , because all of this great choice is plaguing us .
finally , please read this cartoon and a sophisticated person , &quot; Ah , what does this fish know ? &quot;
you know nothing is possible in this goldfish glass .
impoverished fantasy , a short @-@ sighted view of the world , and that &apos;s the way I read it first .
the more I think about it , the more I came to the view that the more fish were aware of it .
because the truth is that if you know the goldfish glass breaking , everything can be done , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you like to break the goldfish glass so that everything is possible , lower your satisfaction .
they increase paralysis and lower the risk of satisfaction .
everyone needs a goldfish glass .
this is certainly too limited , perhaps also for the fish , but definitely for us .
but the lack of a metaphorical goldfish glass is a recipe for misery , and I suspect disaster .
thank you .
