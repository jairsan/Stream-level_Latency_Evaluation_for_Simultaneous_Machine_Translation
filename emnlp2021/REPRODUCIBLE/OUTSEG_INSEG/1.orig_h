last year , I did these two slides , to show you how I can see that the Arctic ice cap that &apos;s going to last for nearly three million years , the size of the bottom 48 states , has shrunk by 40 percent .
but this expresses no strong enough to support the seriousness of this particular problem , because it is not the thickness of the ice .
in some sense , the Arctic Ocean Cap is the beating heart of our global climate system .
they grow in winter and shrink in winter and summer .
the next slide that I &apos;m going to show you is a time lapse , which has been happening in the last 25 years .
this is the continuous ice marked with red .
how to see it , it grows on the dark blue , this is the annual ice in winter , and it shrinks in summer .
this so @-@ called &quot; Dauereis &quot; , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which flows out of the body here .
in 25 years , it will be from here to here , gone .
this is a problem because the problem of warming the frozen ground to the Arctic Ocean is that it &apos;s in the deep ocean , where there &apos;s a lot of frozen carbon that , when it &apos;s depleted , is being converted from microbes to methane .
compared to the total amount of money spent on climate @-@ changing substances in the atmosphere , this figure could double if we were to cross this critical point .
already today , in some flat areas of lakes in Alaska , methane is bubbling by itself from the water .
Professor Katey Walter , University of London , Alaska , is associated with another working group on another flat lake . last winter , he traveled to Alaska .
video : WOW Al Gore , you &apos;re doing well , the question is , &quot; How will we be ? &quot;
and a reason is this enormous amount of heat storage is warming Greenland from the north .
this is a yearly dew water flow .
but the volumes are essentially larger than the volume ever before .
this is the Kangerlussuaq River in the southwest of Greenland .
if you know , how to get to sea level through land ice melting , here it flows into the sea .
this river is rapidly growing .
on the other end of the planet , the Antarctic , the largest ice mass on the planet .
recent month , researchers reported that the entire continent is now a negative ice balance .
and the West Antarctica , which has a few underwater islands , is particularly strong in the melting .
this corresponds to 20 feet above sea level , just like Greenland .
in the Himalayas , the third largest ice mass , you can see new lakes up there , which were glaciers a few years ago .
40 percent of all people on the planet get the half of their drinking water from this melting water .
in the Andes , this glacier is the drinking water source for this city .
the water volumes have increased .
but if you seal it , it will also contain most of the drinking water .
in California , a 40 percent @-@ reduction in snow cover , Sierra , was seen .
this concerns the storage tanks .
and the predictions of how they can read them are serious .
this drying out in the whole world leads to a dramatic change in the amount of fires .
and the disasters everywhere on the planet , have been in a really extraordinary and previously unpredictable way , and have been increasing .
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the last 30 years .
this is a completely unacceptable pattern of development .
if you do this in the historical context , you can see what it &apos;s doing .
in the last 5 years , the number of people we &apos;ve been using has been 70 million tons of CO2 produced every 24 hours , 25 million tons every day in the oceans .
browse our offers of the area of the Eastern Pacific , exactly from the American continent to the west and on both sides of the Indian subcontinent , where there is a drastic decline in oxygen in the oceans .
the largest single factor for the world &apos;s warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning down the fossil fuels .
oil is a problem and coal is a problem , but it is the biggest .
the United States is a major player in the pollution process , along with China .
and the proposal was a lot more coal factories to build .
but we &apos;re starting to change .
here are the ones that are in the last few years deleted , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
but , there is a political struggle in our country .
and the coal industries and oil industries have a quarter of a billion dollars last year spent on clean coal , which is in itself a huge contradiction in itself .
this image reminded me of something that was happening .
to celebrate Christmas , the children of my home ran to Tennessee in a billion tons of coal mud .
they have it , apparently , in the news .
this is in our whole country , the second largest waste flow in America .
this happened to be Christmas .
one of the commercials of the coal industry around Christmas was this .
frosty , the carbarian , is a happy , happy guy .
he gives him in a shell and fullness , in America and he helps us to help our economy grow .
frosty , the carbarian , is killed cleaner every day .
he is affordable and adorable and he is a worker who remains in wages and bread .
al Gore : this is the source of most coal in the West Virginia .
the most powerful miner is the leader of Massey Coal .
video Don Blankenship Let &apos;s take a look at one thing very clearly : al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid . you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
al Gore : so the alliance has a climate change campaign that has launched two campaigns .
this is a very part of the thing .
video actor at the Coalergy see the video of climate change as a serious threat to our business .
that is why we have made it the top line , a considerable amount of money to spend on advertising on the way to making it happen , to clarify the truth about coal .
the fact is that coal is not dirty .
we believe that it &apos;s clean and smells of it , and it &apos;s good .
so we &apos;re going to be worried about the climate change .
leave your hands to us .
video actor Saueber Kohle . you have a lot of it .
so let &apos;s just take a tour of this modern , clean coal factory .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty noisy .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean coal technology .
and yet , burning of coal is a burning thing , one of the main reasons for global warming , is remarkably clean coal technology that you see here changes everything .
browse our offers of the most important things . this is the clean coal technology today .
al Gore : finally , the new positive alternative is mixed with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
video narrator America is in a state of crisis : the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread of this all , which connects , is our dependence on carbon @-@ based fuels , like dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now there &apos;s a brave , new solution to help us out of this miserable situation .
supply America with 100 percent cleaner fuel , new within the EU next 10 years .
a plan to return America to work , to bring us safer , to make us safer and to help reduce global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough , our problems to solve .
supply America New Find America More ... You &apos;ll find out .
al Gore : this is the last .
video narrator : it &apos;s about a new supply of America .
one of the fastest ways to reduce our dependence on old dirty fuels that make our world choke ,
man , the future is wind here , sun and a new energy system .

thank you .
on the last TED conference , there was a introduction to the LHC .
and I promised to go back to the world to explain to them how the machine works .
now it &apos;s a time , and for everyone who wants to be out there at the time , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment , which ever was approached . 27 kilometers in diameter .
his task is to make the conditions more accessible to less people than a billionth of a second after the beginning of the universe , and to do so up to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s easy to just be breathtaking , ambitious .
this is the machine below the surface of Geneva .
we take pictures of these mini @-@ Big Bang in detectors .
and this is where I work , he &apos;s called Atlas Detector , 44 meters wide , 22 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction , so you can see the size .
on 10 September last year , the European Commission launched the first machine to operate .
and this picture was taken by Atlas .
it caused immense cheering in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first particle of radiation that &apos;s going to make the entire route around the LHC , then deliberately moving with part of the LHC to collide with a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture on September 10 , we knew that the people who were working on the machine were working , which is a great triumph .
I know not whether this is the biggest cheering . or this is what someone who has called the Google page , and the home page found that way .
it means that we have a cultural influence , in addition to the scientific achievements .
about a week later , there was a problem with the problem of the machine , which was connected to these wires here , these golden wires , here .
this wires lead 13 thousand amps if the machine is on high performance .
now , the engineers , among them , you &apos;re going to look at them and say , &quot; No , you &apos;re not doing that . &quot; these are small wires .
they can use this because if you do it very far , you can cool it down to so @-@ called superconductors .
and at minus 271 degrees , that &apos;s colder than the space between the stars , these wires can change the tension .
in a single connection between over 30 000 magnets in the LHC , there was a manual defect .
this heat up the wires slightly , and 13 thousand amps met suddenly electric resistance .
this was the result .
now , all this is even more impressive when you imagine that you &apos;re going to have the magnets weigh over 20 tons and weigh about 30 cm and move around .
we damaged the situation of about 50 percent of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we also did .
we conditioned them up , repaired them .
they are now all back on the road .
against the end of March , the LHC will be operational again .
we will not turn it on and expect first data in June or July to collect to be collected , and we will continue our journey to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , in a way , such accidents are once again igniting the debate about the value of science and engineering at such borders . it &apos;s easy to reject this .
I think the fact that there are so hard things to do about the fact that we &apos;re beyond our borders is making the value of the things like the LHC , and it &apos;s a very difficult thing to do .
I &apos;m going to make my final words to an English scientist , Humphrey Davy , who , as I suspect , when he was going to defend his apprentice &apos;s useless experiments , his apprentice was Michael Faraday , saying , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind as to assume that our scientific ideas are definitive , that there are no mysteries in nature , that our triumphs are full of numbers , and that there are no
thank you .
I would like to start by saying to you that you are going to think back to the time you were childhood when you were playing with blocks of blocks .
while they realized how to get the hands stretched out and grab the blocks , and they moved , they actually learned to think about and solve problems by understanding and understanding and changing spatial connections .
this spatial thinking is narrow with it . how we can create a large part of our environment .
as an informatics specialist inspired by the way we interact with real objects together with my own consultant Patti and my colleague Patti Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to think of myself wondering , &quot; What if we were to use computers that were instead of a mouse pointer that was like a digital finger tip on a flat worksurface , what if we were to use both hands to intervene and physically physically grab data ? &quot;
and they so arrange , as they could , as we want .
this question was so gripping that the European Union was going to be able to decide to explore the answer and develop siftables .
in short , a siftable is a interactive computer in the world of a biscuit .
they can be connected by hand . they can be moved by hand , they can perceive each other , they can capture their movements , and they have a screen and a radio receiver .
much more important are physical , which is why they are like building blocks , only by stretching out their hands and accessing , moving .
and the siftables are a sample of a new generation of people &apos;s tools for manipulating digital data .
and if these tools are becoming more physical and a consciousness of their movements , they &apos;re mutually recognizing each other , and the fineness of our handling them , then we can do with exploration of new and entertaining interaction types , and we can start with this exploration .
I &apos;m starting with some simple examples .
this siftable is suitable for video playback . and if I &apos;m going to put it in one direction , the video is going to play forward when I put it in the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards .
and this interactive portrait takes a look at each other .
if I want to put them side by side , then you &apos;re arousing interest .
if you are surrounded by one @-@ wire , you will notice that , and you can become nervous .
and they feel the same way their movements and inclinations .
a very interesting episode of the interactions that we can see that was that we had to do everyday gestures on data , like the colors , the colors , the way we could pour them on liquids .
in this case , we have three siftables as color pots configured and I can &apos;t see them to use color in the color in the middle . where to pour them in the middle , then mix them .
if we do exaggerate it , we can do a little bit of a bit of a backlash .
it &apos;s also available some nice things to do in education . how languages , mathematics , or logic games do we use to give people the opportunity to try out quickly and to get the results right away ?
here I am , that &apos;s a Fibonacci episode that I &apos;ve been able to create with a simple equation program .
this is a game with words , which are a kind of mixture of scrabble and boggle , and it &apos;s a game with words .
basically , you get every round on every siftable random assigned to letters and during you get tried to find words , you get them over a dictionary , and you &apos;re going to check them .
then , after about 30 seconds , it &apos;s mixed again , and you &apos;ve got a new combination of letters and new ways to try out .
thank you .
this is some children who are on a trip to the Media Lab . I could not see them as a way to try it out , and I recorded a video of it .
they have it really loved .
a very interesting fact about this species of applications is that the most interesting thing about people is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
everything that you say is a very good word and it &apos;s you know exactly what to do .
here are some more pictures of people who have tried it .
this is our youngest beta tester there below right .
it was a fact that he was the siftables , stacking only , he was .
so for him , they were just building blocks .
this is a interactive animation .
we wanted to use a language learning tool .
this is Felix .
he can create new characters in the scene . he can bring them to the scene by lifting the siftable from the table that shows this figure .
here , he leaves the sun rising .
now , he &apos;s picking up a tractor in the scene .
good work , yes .
by making the siftables shake and the siftables shake them side by side , he can interact with the characters .
his own story invent .
it &apos;s a story with open @-@ ended and it can be decided how to get it developed .
this last example of the one I &apos;m currently in , it &apos;s showing it , is a music sequencer for live performances that we &apos;ve recently developed , and in which Siftables are called &quot; sound like a voice , a bass , a drums . &quot;
each has four different variations : one can choose which one to use .
and you can &apos;t hear these sounds in the sequence that you &apos;re going to put into any pattern , in turn .
and you eat them in the way you just put a sound @-@ siftable on a sequence @-@ siftable .
there are effects that you can see live changing , like the effects of Hall and Filter .
you connect it to a particular one , and you tend to have it set .
and then , more generally , effects like tempo and volume , which you can see across the sequence .
so look at what we &apos;re looking at .
we start in the process of getting the lead in two sequence siftable , and feeding it in a row , and they &apos;re expanding it , and a little bit more of the voice .
now add me a bass .
now I &apos;m going to do some more stuff about it .
and now I connect the filter to the filter with the drums so that I can see the effect live .
I can &apos;t see the whole sequence accelerating by moving the pace in the one or the other direction .
and now I connect the filter to the filter with the bass for something more expression .
I can &apos;t see the sequence while it runs out .
this means that I do not have to plan them ahead of time , but can improvise , prolong or shorten them .
and finally , I can see the whole sequence by hiding the whole volume @-@ siftable to the left .
thank you .
how to get to know , then , is my enthusiasm for creating new human computer interfaces that are better suited to fit , like our brains and bodies .
and today , I had time to give you part of this new design world , and some of the ways it could show what we &apos;re doing in our lab .
the idea of what I &apos;m going to tell you is to get on the road is that we &apos;re on the threshold of this new generation of witnesses , to interact with digital media that can provide information into our world .
thank you .
I am delighted to see the talks with you all .
I am a writer .
books on writing is my profession . but it &apos;s natural to write more than that .
it &apos;s also my great lifelong life love and fascination .
and I &apos;m not expecting that the world will ever change .
however , recent things are a bit strange in my life and career . that made me feel like that , and it has made me think of my relationship to this work completely .
this strange event was that I was recently a book written , and a biography called &quot; Eat Pray Love , &quot; which decided to be different from all my previous books from some reason in the world , and a big book event , international bestseller thing , became .
this is the result of the fact that I don &apos;t care where I &apos;m coming from , as if I were doomed to doom .
seriously , the sinking is consecrated .
and for example , they &apos;re very worried about me , and they &apos;re saying , &quot; Don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;ll never exceed that success ? &quot;
have you not been afraid that you can make your whole life continue and never again write a book ? that &apos;s something that anybody in the world is interested in ? never again .
okay , that really makes you brave .
it would be worse , however , if I did not remember it , that I was going to be a little over 20 years ago , when I was a teenager , when I first told me that I wanted to be a writer , faced with the same kind of fear @-@ filled reaction .
the people said , &quot; Have you not been afraid , never to succeed ? &quot;
have you not been afraid that you will be humiliated by a rejection ?
have you not been afraid that you will be able to make your life go on for this craft and never come up with anything from it , and that you will die on a scrap pile of burst dreams ? your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failure .
so , about you know .
the answer that is short answer to all these questions is that of course .
yes , I &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and the one I always had .
and I &apos;ve been looking forward to a lot more things , which nobody would ever suspect of , like algae and other terrifying things .
but if it comes to writing , I think since recently , I &apos;ve been thinking about it , and I wonder why .
is that reasonable ?
is it logical that the idea of someone to be expected to be afraid of it is to get the job done ? to which he is called ,
and what exactly is the case with the creative enterprises that are going on to uncertain us about mutual mental state ? in a way that we can see other professions not doing it .
my father to say , was a chemist , and I can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist , in which he was asked , if he was afraid , chemist , to be .
with your chemist blockade John , how are you doing it ?
it came just not before knowing how to do it .
but to be fair , the people of the chemists have a lot of experience over the centuries , not of the reputation of alcoholic , manic @-@ depressive people .
we writers seem to have this kind of reputation . but we writers don &apos;t just have the writers , but the creative minds of all genres seem to have this reputation , mentally unstable , unstable .
everything that you do you have to do is to get the bitter death figures from really great heads alone from the 20th century , young people and often from their own hands died .
and even those who don &apos;t actually suicide , seemed to be beginning from their talents really neglected .
Norman Mailer said briefly before his visit to the United States last interview : &quot; each of my books has made me a little further killed .
a special statement that you have about your life &apos;s work ,
but we &apos;re not even twitching when we &apos;re not even watching someone say this because we &apos;re not hearing this kind of statement for so long , somehow we &apos;ve got that view , so we &apos;ve internalized and collectively accepted that creativity and suffering somehow naturally belong together , and that art at the end always ends up causing torment .
the question that I have asked everyone here today is this : is this idea for the people of you perfectly okay ?
feel free to do so .
because with only one centimeter distance , you see , I feel like I &apos;m in the process of not feeling comfortable at all .
I think it &apos;s horrible .
and I think they &apos;re dangerous and I want to not watch how they go to the next century .
I think it &apos;s better if we want to make our great creative encouragement to live .
and I know definitely that it &apos;s a very good idea for me in my situation to start by trying to find this dark path of presumption , so to speak , leakage , especially in the fact that I &apos;m in my career .
this means seeing you , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m just about 40 years old , I &apos;m just a little bit like that .
I have perhaps not yet received another 40 years of work .
and it &apos;s extremely likely that the whole thing I &apos;ve heard from now on will be written by the world as the work that &apos;s being evaluated after the departure of success of my last book , right ?
I say it straight out , because we &apos;re here now , all of us , kind of friends , it &apos;s most likely that my greatest success is behind me .
Oh Jesus , what a thought !
this is the way we think about it , which leads someone to do it at 9 a.m. Gin Gin to get drunk and that &apos;s what I don &apos;t want .
I would rather continue to do this work , which I love .
so it &apos;s the question of how ?
after some time of reflection , it seems to me that I am going to be able to continue writing a kind of protective psychological construct that I need to design .
somehow , I have to get from now on to find a way to write a safe distance from being true between me and my very natural anxiety about how the way the response to the written being will be .
while I was in the last year , according to models for doing this , I was looking for models for this , too , in the past , and I tried to get other societies to find ways to see if they might be better or more sensible about it than we did about how to help creative people to get emotional risks around that with creativity , and how to do it .
this search led me to the old Greece and the old Greece ,
please follow the instructions , because the circle will change again .
but in the old Greece and Rome , the people don &apos;t believe that creativity is the creativity of people . okay .
they believed that creativity was a kind of divine servant spirit that came from a distant , unknown source to people , to people , to people for inexplicable , unknown reasons .
the Greeks called these divine servants spirits of creativity demons .
from Socrates , it is known that he believed that he had a demon , who gave him wisdom from afar .
the Romans had the same idea : they called this kind of body @-@ less , creative spirit a genius .
this is great , the Romans thought not really that a man genius was a particularly smart individual .
they believed that a genius would not have this kind of magical divine being that believed that it was a proverb , literally , in the walls of an artist &apos;s studio , about the same way Dobby , the housekeeper , would come out of the room and , in a sense , assistive the artist in the work , and would shape the result of the work .
this is brilliant , there &apos;s it , there &apos;s the distance from the one I talked about , the psychological construct that separates you from the consequences of your work .
and everyone knew that it was like this , right ?
the artist of antiquity was in front of certain things protected , such as the way too much narcissism was right .
if your work is brilliant , you could not do anything . for you , everyone could know that you could do this body @-@ less genius that helped you .
if your work flopped , not entirely your mistake or
everyone knew your genius was something that was lame .
so we have people in the West really long time been talking about creativity .
and then came the Renaissance and then everything changed . we were having these great ideas . and this great idea , this big idea , was , let &apos;s put the human individual at the center of the universe , about all the gods and mysteries , and there &apos;s no room for mystical creatures anymore , to accept the commands of the Divine .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational thinking of humanism , and people started to believe that the creativity is completely different from their own individual .
and for the first time in history , you hear people hear this or that artist , a genius , call it , instead of being a genius .
I have to tell you , I think that was a great mistake .
know , I think one thing you know is to allow a mere person to think he or she &apos;s like that vessel , like the basin , and the essence , and the source of all divine creative , unknown , infinite mystery , is a little bit too much responsibility to give them a fragile human psyche .
it &apos;s like somebody is asking you to see the sun swallow .
this distorts and distorts whole ego &apos;s and it creates all the things that are unattainable expectations of success .
I think that this pressure to succeed , our artists , of the last 500 years , has destroyed .
and if the right thing is true , and I think it &apos;s true , the question is :
can we do that ?
maybe to a ancient understanding of the world &apos;s relationship between people and the mystery of the creative , to return .
maybe not .
maybe you can &apos;t understand the thought from 500 years of rational humanism simply in a single 18 @-@ minute talk .
and it &apos;s certainly people in the world who are really really justified in scientific doubt about how to get the idea of basically fairies , the people follow , and the fairy @-@ birds on their projects , etc .
I &apos;m probably not going to see all of you on this journey .
but the question that I raise is that the reason why not ?
why not do it think so ?
because it makes just as much sense as anything else from the world I hear . if I have to do with the absolutely crazy @-@ making whim @-@ heartedness of the creative process , it &apos;s all about explaining .
a process that is like any other , as everyone knows , who has ever tried to do something , in other words , everyone here , not always sensible , is doing something .
in the end , he can &apos;t even imagine himself paranormal at times .
I had recently had such an encounter as I saw the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone , who was now talking about 90 , and who is her whole life , but she was a poet , and she told me that when she was in Virginia , she grew up in the village , she was working outside in the fields , and she said she would feel and hear a poem about the landscape coming up to her .
they said it was like a kind of thundering train out of air .
the information about the country on you is going to roll .
they felt when it came , because it would make the earth under their feet a reality of trembling .
they knew that they were in a sort of moment just one thing that they could do , and that was in their words , &quot; Race like the devil . &quot;
they ran like the devil to the house while they were driven by this poem . it was going only to be about them quickly enough to get to a sheet of paper and a pen , and they had to get it if it was through them thunder , catch it and get it on the sheet .
and in other paintings , she wasn &apos;t quick enough , she ran and ran and ran , but she reached the house , not , and the poem rolled through her , and she missed it , she said , she said it would go on going over land , and as she said , after another poet , she was looking for it .
and then there was this moment , the part I &apos;m going to never forget . &quot; she said it was moments in which she was going to miss it .
so you run to the house and look for the paper . and the poem goes on through it , and it goes on , and it picks up a pen just as it goes through it , and then she said , &quot; It &apos;s like it &apos;s like you &apos;re grabbing with your other hand and grabbing it .
they caught the poem on his own tail and pulled it out . they pulled it back into their bodies and took it over to the paper .
and in these occasions , the poem came perfectly and intact , on paper , but on the back of the last word , on the first .
as I saw it , I thought , &quot; This is scary . &quot; that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is going on .
this is not at all like my creative process . I &apos;m not the channel .
I am a mule to work to get to work , I have to go to work every day at the same time , sweat , work , and really torment me unpleasantly .
but even I , in my mule species , sometimes have this thing striped .
and I guess that many of you , many of you , have done that .
even I had work or ideas , which came from a source through me , which were what I really didn &apos;t identify .
what is this ? what is it ?
and how do we get into this relationship without talking about it , without losing our mind , but rather , on the contrary , even with mental health ?
for me , this is the best living example of how to do this , the musician Tom Waits . I was allowed to see him a few years ago for a magazine .
we talked about the situation here , and we know what we &apos;re talking about most of his life , Tom , the embodiment of tormented modern artist , who was trying to make these uncontrollable creative impulses that lived in him , and who lived with them .
but then it was getting older and quieter , and he told me that he would one day be on a highway in Los Angeles , and there he changed everything , and it was for him .
he went with high speed as he was suddenly a little bit fragment of a melody . he heard it as it was often with inspirations , for him tormenting , hard to grasp , and he wants to have it . she &apos;s gorgeous , he &apos;s laughing , but he can &apos;t grasp it .
he has no piece of paper , he has no pen , he has no cassette recorder .
he starts with this old anxiety , in him ascending like a little bit like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose this thing , &quot; and I &apos;m going to be persecuted forever by this song .
I am not good enough , I create it ,
but instead of panic , we &apos;re hearing him just stop .
he finished the whole course of thought and did something completely new .
he looked at the world in the sky and said , &quot; Excuse me , can &apos;t you see I &apos;m driving a car ? &quot;
see , I look like I could be just looking at a song .
if you really exist , come and see a cheaper moment . if you want to get around you , I can take care of you .
if not tortures today , someone else .
go and torment Leonard Cohen
his whole process of work has then changed .
not the work itself , which was still often the dark , as it was ever , was .
but the process and the gravity of the clutter that surrounds it was lifted when it was the genius of itself . where the world was , it was nothing but trouble , and it left it to where it came from , so to speak , he realized that there was no inner tormenting thing to be .
it could be a strange , strange , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between Tom and the foreign , external thing that wasn &apos;t quite Tom .
as I saw this story , I changed it , too , a little bit , the way I worked , and it made me feel like I &apos;ve saved .
this idea saved me from being a real real writer in the middle of the writing process of Eat Pray Love . I fell into one of those ducts of doubt that we all fall into when we work on something and don &apos;t work out . you catch thinking that it &apos;s a disaster that &apos;s going to make it the worst book ever written .
not only bad , but the worst of all times .
I started to think , I should be doing the project just stamping .
but then I remembered that I was thinking about Tom in the free sky . and I was thinking about it ,
I raised the question of my view from the manuscript and I said my comment towards a blank corner of space ,
I spoke loudly , listen , you &apos;re doing , you and I both know , if this book isn &apos;t brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see , you see , I &apos;m all I have , I &apos;m investing , I &apos;ve got no more than that .
if you don &apos;t know better , you have to go here . you have to keep your share of the deal .
okay , but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what &apos;s the hell about it .
I &apos;m going to continue writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and I want to ask for a record that I am today voting for my part of the job here .
because on the end , it &apos;s like this : centuries ago , in the deserts , North Africa people turned to moonlight festivals with holy dances and music , which were held for hours , until dawn .
this solid was always great , because the dancers were professional , professional , and they were fantastic .
but go and go very rarely , very rarely , something special happened , one of the actors actually became superworldly .
and I know that they know that what I mean , because I know that they &apos;re all in their lives , and they &apos;ve ever been offering this kind of performance .
it was when it was time to stop and the dancer was going through a kind of gate , he did nothing else than he was doing it before . &quot; &#91; 1 &#93; 1,000 nights earlier , but everything was going together .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t appear to be pure , human anymore .
he was arrested from within and was illuminated from below , and everything illuminated himself through the light of a divine fire .
as such , at that time , the people knew what the thing was , they called it at its name .
they put the hands together and they started to sing : &quot; Allah , Allah , God , God , God . &quot;
this is God . you know .
interesting historical footnote as the Ethiopian Moors ( southern Spain ) conquered , they brought this custom with them , the debate changed over the centuries from Allah . Allah Allah to Olé Olé Olé Olé , which is still to be seen in bullfights and flamenco dances .
if a performer in Spain has something impossible , something magical , done , Allah Olé Olé Allah , great Bravo , incomprehensible , there it is a volatile look at God .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
but the tricky part follows the path closest to the day when the dancer wakes up and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 a.m. on a Tuesday . and it &apos;s not he &apos;s no longer a little bit of God in himself .
he is only a aging mortal , with painful knees and painful knees , and perhaps he will never again be able to rise to these heights .
and maybe it &apos;s never going to be someone else who will call God &apos;s name again when he turns , but what is he supposed to do with the rest of his life ?
this is hard .
this is a very painful correction . a creative life .
but maybe you have to be quite a bit tormented . if you &apos;re talking about it from the beginning , you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of your life would come from you .
if you might just believe that the truth is that you are a loan from an unimaginable source for a fine time of your life that is connected to someone else &apos;s life , when you &apos;re done with it .
if we start , then think about it , it changes all .
so I &apos;ve started to think , and so I think I &apos;m sure I &apos;m going to have been thinking in the past few months , working on the book that &apos;s going to be coming soon , when the dangerous , frightening , much @-@ awaited successor of my departed success .
what I &apos;m constantly looking at is what I have to say when I get crazy about it , I &apos;m not afraid .
be not discouraged , just make your job .
be still responsible for your contribution , as what is always he , whatever .
if your job is dancing , you dance .
if the situation is stupid , divine genius that leads you to the side , then decide for a short moment to have a breath of wonder through your effort to show you , then Olé .
and if not , dance your body ,
and Olé for you , despite all this .
I believe that , and I have the feeling that we should do this .
Olé for you , despite all this , just for you to be the mere human love and attachment . for that , because you have to be .
thank you .
thank you .
June Cohen Olé
they know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human being genome and what the genome means , and about some of the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point , we &apos;ve got biology digitized , and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code to a new phase of biology , by moving new life into new life and building up .
we have always tried to answer important questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something that I think is something that many biologists have tried to understand and understand , and that at different levels .
we have different approaches , trying to make it to the point of minimising components .
we have almost 20 years of digitization when we saw the human genome sequencing , and we &apos;ve been changing from the analogue world of biology to the digital world of biology , the computer .
now try to get to know if we live , regenerate , or whether we can regenerate new life . from this , digital universe .
this is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma geitalium , which is the smallest genome of a species that has itself in the lab replicating itself , and we have tried to see if we could do this with an even smaller genome .
we have it done to get around a hundred genes out of it , of the 500 or so genes that are here .
but if we look at these metabolic cards , which are very simple , in comparison to what we trust , they tell me , that &apos;s simple , but if we all look at these genes that we have one after another , we can eliminate one after the other , it &apos;s very unlikely that this will lead to a living cell .
so we have therefore decided that we should be the only way to move forward , and this chromosome actually synthesize it , which allows us to actually synthesize the individual components and thus to change some of these fundamental questions .
and so they started to talk to the question , &quot; Can we make a chromosome synthesize ? &quot;
allows it to reduce chemistry , this really big molecule , to what &apos;s never been done before .
and if we do , we can do that , we can start the chromosome .
a chromosome is so incidental , only one piece of inert chemical material .
our steps at the digitisation of the life were exponential .
our ability to use genetic code to write has changed very slowly . but still , it has increased and our last point would now be on an exponential curve .
we have a 15 @-@ year @-@ old start with it .
it took us some years to start with a bioethical review , before we started to do the first experiments .
how the situation turned out , DNA synthesization is very difficult .
it &apos;s tens of thousands of machines around the world , the little pieces of DNA that can make , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a degenerative process , so the longer you make a piece , the more errors happen .
so we had to create a new method that would allow us to use these little pieces together and make the mistakes correct .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome Phi X , 174 .
it &apos;s a small virus that &apos;s bacteria killing .
we created small pieces , made a bug correction , and we had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we were able to inert this piece of chemical and put it into a bacterium , and the bacterium started to develop the genetic code and read it , and it made viral particles .
the viral particles were then removed from the cells . and the viral particles came back and killed E. coli .
recently , I started working with the oil industry , and they said that they were using this model .
they laughed more than their , it &apos;s doing it here . so let &apos;s think that this is a situation where software actually has its own hardware , and in fact , it can build its own hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to have a lot more going on , we wanted to have a whole bacterial chromosome built , it has more than 580,000 letters of genetic code , so we thought , &quot; We &apos;re building it in cassettes of the size of the virus , which means we &apos;re changing the size of the cassettes to understand what the individual components of a living cell are .
design is the key and if you &apos;re going to talk to digital information in the computer , it &apos;s necessary to really do this digital information without any errors .
as we saw the genome for the first time in 1995 , the error rate was at one error per 10,000 base pairs .
we found a lot of errors in resequencing , 30 if we could use the original sequence , it would never have been possible to go up .
a part of the design is to make pieces . 50 pieces that contain 50 letters are long and that are connected to 50 letters that overlap pieces to create smaller sub @-@ units so that they fit together .
we have unique elements here .
they have perhaps heard that we are watermarks built in .
think about it . we &apos;ve got a 4 @-@ letter code A , C , G and T .
triplets : these letters , these letters , encode about 20 amino acids , and here &apos;s a single determination for each of these amino acids .
so you can see the genetic code that we use to use our words to write , sentences , thoughts .
at first we only signed .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
we have the pieces so constructed that they are not easy to use with enzymes . it &apos;s like enzymes that have these repaired and repairing these pieces .
and we &apos;ve started to play pieces . starting with pieces , which are five to seven thousand letters , these pieces put together to make 24,000 letters , to make these pieces back together , up to 72,000 .
in each step , we have these pieces in surplus , and so that we can sequence them , because we tried to make a very robust process , which they did in a minute , and what they would see .
we have tried to get to the point of automation .
so , that looks like a little basketball playoff .
if we go to these really big pieces , with over 80 percent of the base pairs , then they &apos;re not going to be just growing in E.coli , it &apos;s going to exceed all the possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we turned to other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism that was called homologous recombination , called the one biology uses , to make DNA repair , to repair those pieces that can merge .
here &apos;s a sample of this , there &apos;s an organism called Deinococcus radiodurans , which has three million wheel of radiation surviving .
they see in the upper field that his chromosome is simply apart .
12 to 24 hours later , the first thing happened again .
we have thousands of organisms that have done that .
this organisms can be totally dried up , and they can even be living in vacuum .
I am absolutely sure that life will be in space and that life will be able to move , looking for aquatic conditions .
in fact , NASA has shown that it has a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a picture of the image of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using this process , and actually , actually , we have only used yeast mechanisms with the right design of the pieces , and we &apos;ve adapted them to it . yeast then automatically adds them together .
this is not an electron microscope , it &apos;s a regular microscope image .
it &apos;s like this : a big molecule that we even do it with the light microscope , we can see it .
this is a picture of a duration of 6 seconds .
this is the publication that we &apos;ve just recently finished .
this is about 580 000 letters , and it &apos;s genetic code , it &apos;s the largest molecule with a defined structure that ever happens to be created by humans .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
if we do not have a font size of 10 and without spacing , we would have to print 142 pages . only to print this genetic code would it be 142 pages .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s a problem with a virus that &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier if you look at it in eukaryotes , as we are , and you do , you just take out the nucleus and you give it another one , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;re all talking about cloning , and you know .
and in archaebacteria , the chromosome is integrated into the cell , but it &apos;s just recently that we &apos;ve shown that you can actually see a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another , and you can activate it .
we cleaned the chromosome of a microbial species , roughly . in other words , these two are as far from each other as humans and mice . we gave some extra genes to enable us to select this chromosome , we decomposed it with enzymes to destroy all proteins , and it was very amazing when we saw it in a cell , and they &apos;re going to be our very mature graphics here .
this new chromosome went into the brain cell .
in fact , we thought that this was the end , but we tried to get the process a little further .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we find all kinds of species of species here that have a second chromosome taken up , or a third of any other , every time thousands of characteristics in just one second , to add to a species .
people , therefore , who imagine evolution as a gene that &apos;s going to be changed at a time , have a lot of missed biology .
it &apos;s enzymes that have called restrictive enzymes , which actually actually digest DNA .
this chromosome , which is in the cell , has none of the chromosomes that we inserted , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been doing .
it was built in the cell , and it realized the other chromosome as a foreign material , digested it , and so we had at the end only one cell with a new chromosome .
it discolored , blue because of the genes that we inserted , and it was a very dark thing .
and after a very short time , I had all the characteristics of the species lost , and I converted them completely into a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve been going to give into the cell .
all proteins changed , the membranes changed , the membranes changed when we saw the genetic code , it was exactly that , what we transferred was .
it may seem like genomic alchemy . but we can do it by making the software DNA move things quite dramatically , and we can change things quite dramatically .
now I &apos;ve argued that this is not the Genesis , but the Genesis is based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and I &apos;ve argued that we &apos;re probably going to be doing a new form of Cambrian explosion , and in that we &apos;re going to have massive new species formation based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious that in terms of what I mean , we need to .
we are in the process of being six and a half to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to do so in my context , I think I was in the year 1946 .
today , three people are on this planet for everyone who wants to be in 1946 . within the space of 40 years , there will be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6 , 5 billion people .
it will be a challenge to do this for 9 .
we need to have over five billion tons of coal , 30 @-@ plus billion barrels of oil , which is a hundred million barrels a day .
if we talk about biological processes , or any process to get the process replaced , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
then of course , there &apos;s the whole CO2 from this material that &apos;s in the atmosphere , of course .
we have now come from our discoveries , from all over the world , to create a database of about 20 million genes , and I want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
the electronics industry had a dozen components and they see that they &apos;re all diverse , and the diversity that came out of them .
we meet here in the first place , the borders of the biological reality and the limits of our idea .
we have today developed technologies based on this fast synthesis method to make this happen , what we can call combinatorial genetics .
we have now the opportunity to create a large robot , and it &apos;s going to have millions of chromosomes a day .
if you are thinking of these 20 million different genes being produced , or these processes being optimized to be octane @-@ produced , or drugs being new vaccines , we can use a small team of just a little team to change molecular biology more than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just Male selection . we can go for viability , we can select chemicals production or fuel production , vaccine production , and so on .
this is a recording of real life design software on which we work , with which you can actually sit down and create new species on the computer , you know .
know , we know not necessarily . how it looks like . we know exactly how it &apos;s genetic code that looks like .
we focus on the future of fuel from the fourth generation .
they have recently been using corn to produce ethanol , which is simply a bad experiment .
we have fuels from the second and third generation , which are relatively soon to come out , which will have much higher sugar @-@ making activities , like octane or different kinds of butanol .
but how we think the only thing we can do is to make biology have a big impact without further increasing costs on food or limiting food costs to availability . if you have a big impact on CO2 as the raw material , and so we &apos;re working on cells that are going that way .
and we think that we can &apos;t get the first of the fourth generation fuels , and we think that &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and CO2 are a method of doing so .
but in our discovery of the world , we &apos;ve all kinds of different methods .
this is a body that we have been describing in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about one and a half miles deep , at almost boiling water temperatures .
it turns CO2 into methane , and it &apos;s using carbon dioxide to be the source of energy .
we study whether we can use stored CO2 . what &apos;s simple to use in production places ? convert that CO2 to carbon fuel to make it a process .
within a short period of time , we believe that we could be able to make one of the fundamental questions of life solve .
know , we &apos;ve really got moderate targets like the replacement of the entire petrochemical industry , exactly when you &apos;re going to not do this at TED , where else would be a major source of energy .
but just as we &apos;re working on this right now , we &apos;re working on the same approach to vaccines .
they have it . this year , they have seen flu , and we &apos;re always a year behind , and they have a dollar too little if it comes to flu , and we &apos;re just a year behind it .
I think that the change is going to be made by recombinant vaccines in advance .
this is what it &apos;s like the future , maybe , could look like . with changes , today , the evolutionary tree can be accelerated , with synthetic bacteria , archaea , and possibly eukaryotes .
we are light years away from people being able to improve our goal , and our goal is to just have a chance to have a long enough chance to survive , to possibly do that . thank you .
what I &apos;m going to tell you first as quickly as possible is the basic work that is going to be a new technology that we call Microsoft part of a takeover just a year ago , which is Seadragon .
and it &apos;s a environment in which people can either be local or away with huge amounts of food and visual data , and they can do it .
we see many , many gigabytes of digital photos here , the one that you can seamlessly and continuously get up to , swivel , rearrange in any way .
and it &apos;s no matter how many information we look at , how big these collections are , or how big the images are .
the majority of them are digital digital photos of a camera , but this one is about , for example , a scan from the Congress Library , and it &apos;s in an area of 300 megapixels .
it makes no difference , because the only thing that makes the performance of a system like this can limit is the number of pixels on the screen on your screen .
every moment , it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , a sample of non @-@ image data .
this is Bleak House of Dickens , each column is a very chapter .
to get to know that it &apos;s really a matter of a text , not a text , not a picture , we can do something like that , to really show that this is a real representation of the text , not an image .
maybe it &apos;s a artificial way of doing this , reading an e @-@ book .
I would like to recommend it !
this is a more realistic case , and this is an output of The Guardian .
each large picture is the beginning of a section .
and that gives them really the real pleasure and pleasure of the good experience of producing a real paper edition of a magazine or a newspaper , which in itself is a kind of medium of several orders of magnitude .
we have also something to do with the corner of this special edition of The Guardian .
we have a false message with a very high resolution , designed to make much higher than in a normal ad , and we have a very high content added .
if you want to use the features of this car , you can see them here .
or other models or even technical models or specifications .
and this is really taking these ideas up , these restrictions on the available space , on the screen , to abolish .
we hope that the Commission will not be able to make pop @-@ ups and other nonsense , and that this should not be necessary .
of course , mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this one .
and I want to really not do much time here , except to say that we &apos;re also going to go to this area .
but this is all the streets in the U.S.A. , and all of them .
in a different way , on the top of the Earth &apos;s Earth @-@ lined image of NASA .
let &apos;s just let us do something else .
this is now even live in the Internet . you can do it .
this is a project with which we can call Photosynth , which really has two different technologies that connect .
the first is Seadragon and the second is Seadragon , and the other is a very good research on computer vision that is done by Noah Snavely , a university student at Washington University , under Steve Seitz &apos;s advice at UW .
and Rick Szeliski of Microsoft Research , conducted was a very , very good collaboration .
so this is live in the Internet , it &apos;s being used by Seadragon .
they can use this to see if we can see these kinds of views that we create , where we can penetrate through images , and this experience of multiple resolution .
but the spatial arrangement of the images is here in the form of a matter of fact .
the computer vision algorithms have these images together , so that they can give the real space in which these recordings , all of which are close to Grassi Lakes in the Canadian Rockies , were made , correspond . you see , here , elements of stabilized slides or panoramic image processing , and these things were all spatially related to each other .
I know not exactly whether I am still time . I am not sure if I have time to show you other environments .
it &apos;s what the many spatial differences are .
I would like to make a straight one of the original records of Noah , and that &apos;s from an early prototype of photosynth to an early prototype of photosynth , where we first worked in the summer to show you what I think I think it really was the point behind this technology , photosynth technology , and this is not , of course , so obvious when you look at the environments that we &apos;re looking at the website .
we had to look at the lawyers , etc .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral Notre Dame , which is built exclusively in computer .
with pictures of Flickr , we gave you just Notre Dame , in Flickr , and we put you pictures of Flickr men in T @-@ shirts and on the university grounds , etc .
get each of these orange cone represents a picture that is seen as being too belonging to this model .
so , this is all Flickr images , and they &apos;re all spatially on this way , in relation to each other .
and we can &apos;t wait for this very simple way .
know , I &apos;ve never believed that you know , I &apos;ve ultimately worked with Microsoft .
I am very grateful for the work that has been done here .
I suspect you can see that you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras , and everything is from mobile phones to professional SLRs , a pretty large number of them , all of them flicked together in this environment .
and if possible , I &apos;ll get some of the strange ones , many of them are faces covered , etc .
somewhere here are a number of different photographs here , and here they are .
this is actually a poster of the Notre Dame , which is recorded correctly .
we can expect the poster to be a physical view of this environment .
the point is here that we &apos;re going to do things with the social environment , and it &apos;s going to be data collected from all of you .
from the whole collective memory , of how visually the Earth is looking , and everything is going to be connected .
all these photos are taken together . and it &apos;s something that &apos;s getting bigger than that that sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes from the whole world .
consider the fact that this is the continuation of the work of Stephen Lawler on Virtual Earth .
and that &apos;s something that &apos;s going to be done by complexity that people use it to grow and that &apos;s what it &apos;s going to be doing for the user with the application getting bigger and bigger .
your own photos will be taken with metadata that shows a different person entering another person .
if the person who is bothering to do so and all of these saints have labeled himself and tells who they all are , then my heart will take a picture of the Notre Dame Cathedral suddenly with all these data , and I can see it as a starting point to go to this room to dive into this metaverse , to take photos of other people , and so I can use some kind of cross @-@ modal social experience with the use of other providers .
and of course by @-@ product , all of this is the immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the world that are not only superflights or satellite images , and so on , but also collective memory .
thank you .
Chris Anderson : I understand you right , your software allows you to make a difference at a certain time within the next few years , all the images that someone in the world uses together , basically , are interconnected .
BAA : yes , she doesn &apos;t do anything else than discover if you want , she creates hyperlinks between the pictures .
and they do this because of the content in the pictures ,
and that &apos;s really exciting when you &apos;re on the fullness of the semantic information that you &apos;ve got to think of , many of these images .
how if you want to find a web search for images where you enter sentences and the text of the website contains many information about which images you want to see ?
but how about it if the world &apos;s picture were to take you with all your pictures ?
then it &apos;s the size of the semantic cross @-@ connection , and the abundance that comes from it , really .
huge , it &apos;s a classic network effect .
ca Blaise : that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations , Baa , you &apos;ve got . thank you very much .
know , one of the big folks in traveling and one of the joys in travelling , in ethnographic research , is , together with people , to live who are still interested in the old days , and who can remember their past , which are still feeling the wind , to get smoothed on rocks , to touch them in bitter leaves of plants , to taste .
just the knowledge that Jaguar shamans still know beyond the Milky Way is travelling , or the importance of myths , the elders of Inuit , is still full of meaning , or that in the Himalayas , the Buddhists still breathe the breath of Dharma . if the central revelation of the anthropology is remembered , the central revelation of anthropology means to recall : that &apos;s the thought that the world in which we live , not in an absolute sense , exists
as a result of a group of certain possibilities of adaptation , which our ancestors , although successful , had been able to choose many generations ago .
and of course , we all share the same adaptive needs .
we will all be born , we bring children to the world .
we go through initiation rituals .
we must look at the unstoppable nature of separation by death , and we must therefore be able to avoid surprise at the fact that we all sing , dance and art .
but interesting is the unique tone of the song , the rhythm of dance in every single culture .
and it &apos;s not important whether it &apos;s a matter of the Penan in the woods , in Borneo , or whether it &apos;s voodoo acolites in Haiti , or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of northern Kenya , the Curanderos in the Andes , or a caravan factory in the middle of the Sahara . this is by chance the colleague I met a month ago in the desert , or even a Yak shepherd in the slopes of Qomolang@@
Everest , the godmother of the world
all these people teach us that all these people are still living , other ways of thinking , other ways of orientating themselves on Earth .
and that &apos;s a notion that &apos;s what , if you think about it , you can only fill it with hope .
together , the countless cultures of the world form a network of spiritual and cultural life . this network of cultures encloses the earth and is responsible for the good of the earth as important as the biological network of life that is known as the biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural network of life as an ethnosphere , ethnosphere can be seen as the total sum of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations and intuitions that are inspired by human imagination since the beginning of consciousness .
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of the human race .
they are the symbol of all this that we are and they are what we call amazing , curious species .
and just like the biosphere is strongly removed , it happened . with the ethnosphere , it happened only with even greater speed .
no biologist would be able to dare to claim , for example , that 50 % or more of all species are just before extinction , because it &apos;s just not true , and yet this is the most apocalyptic scenario in the field of biodiversity , hardly anything that we think is the most optimistic scenario in the field of cultural diversity is known .
and the decisive indicator of this is the extinction of languages , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about .
as everyone from them in this field is born , they were born on Earth , 6000 languages were spoken .
now it &apos;s a language that &apos;s not just the whole vocabulary , or a number of grammar rules .
a language is an expression of human spirit .
they are a means of using the power of a certain soul to access a particular culture to the material world .
each language is like a legacy . forest of spirit , a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and from these 6000 languages , we &apos;re going to talk today , while we &apos;re sitting here in Monterey , exactly half of them are not going to whisper into the ears of kids .
they will be little children no longer taught , that is , if nothing is done , they are actually dead .
what could be lonely than from the silence enveloped ? a man who is one of the last of your people to be your language speaking , not a way to have wisdom of ancestors passed on or to have hope of being children ?
and yet , this terrible fate is actually happening to someone somewhere on Earth , about all two weeks , because every two weeks , a life @-@ old person dies and takes the last syllables of an old language with him into the grave .
and I know that some of the people say , &quot; Is it not better ? &quot; so the world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we all had one language to speak , and I say , &quot; Well , let this language be Yoruba . &quot; let it be cantonal .
let them know how to be Kogi .
and then we would suddenly see that they &apos;re going to see how it would be if they didn &apos;t speak their own language .
that is why I would like to draw your attention today to a journey through the ethnosphere , a short journey through the ethnosphere , to try to make you understand . what actually lost was actually lost .
now there &apos;s some of us , who are so to speak forgotten that if I say different ways of being , I really have different ways of being .
take a look at this kid , the Barasana , in the northwest of the Amazon , the Anaklona people , for example , who believe that they mythologically believe that they &apos;re going to see the flow of milk coming up from the east in the belly of holy snakes .
this is a people who are not cognitive between the colors of blue and green , and because the tent of heaven is different from the forest from the one people depend on .
they have a strange language and they have a marriage rule , linguistic exogamy , called linguistic exogamy , and you have to marry someone who speaks another language .
all this is rooted in mythological history . the peculiar thing about these great houses in the world , where mixed marriages made up six or seven languages , is , however , that you never hear someone who has a language learning .
they hear only to listen and start then to speak .
or a man who &apos;s the most fascinating tribes I &apos;ve ever lived with , the Waorani , in the northeast of Ecuador , an amazing people , who first peacefully lived in 1958 .
in the year 1957 , five missionaries tried to get in touch and made a serious mistake .
they threw shiny photos of themselves . what they did was they threw shiny photos from the air , which we would rate as a kind gesture , and they forgot that these people from the rainforest have never seen anything two @-@ dimensional in their lives .
they raised these photographs from the forest floor , tried to get behind the face or figure , and they found nothing and concluded that this was business cards of the devil and killed the five missionaries .
but the Waorani killed not only the outsiders with the spear ,
they pierced through each other .
54 % of deaths were caused by drillings .
we followed the geneaology eight generations , back and found two generations of cases of natural death and when we saw the people with emphasis something like this , we gave them a message that one of the people of this age had become so old that he was dying because of his age , and we killed him anyway with the spear , but at the same time they had a clear knowledge of the forest that was amazing .
your hunters could not control the urine of an animal from 40 steps away and determine the origin of the animal of which it belonged .
in the early 1980s , the first time I got a really amazing job when my wife professor was in Harvard , and I was asked if I was interested in going to Haiti and the secret societies that I was trying to infiltrate , which was the foundation of duvalier and tonton macoutes , and the poison that was used to infiltrate the zombies that were the foundation of duvalier and tonton macoutes .
to get this sensation a sense , I had to be sure of course , to talk about this remarkable faith of Vodoun and Voodoo is not a cult of black magic .
in fact , it &apos;s a very important complex metaphysical view of the world .
it &apos;s interesting .
if I want to ask you questions , the big world religions , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , Judaism or whatever .
a continent will always be omitted , because the presumption was that it was in black Africa that there was no religious faith . of course , there was one , and Voodoo is simply the remnant of these very profound religious thoughts that were born during the tragic diaspora of the slavery era .
but what Voodoo is so interesting is that this living relationship is between the living and the living and the dead .
the living give birth to the spirits .
the spirits can be heard from under the great water . answers : &quot; to the rhythm of dance , to the soul of the living temporarily pass away , so that the acolyth is for a short , shining moment to God , &quot;
Deshab say , &quot; Voodooists like to tell her , &quot; Whites go to church and talk about God . &quot;
we dance in the temple and become a god .
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to be obsessed with the Spirit . how can you be hurt ?
see the pictures of these amazing demonstrations of voodoo @-@ acolytes in a trance state , the glowing coal without burning , and an amazing illustration of the spirit &apos;s ability to influence the body in such a way that it can endure it when it enters a state of extreme excitement .
now from all people who I &apos;ve met , they were the Kogi from the Sierra de Nevada de Santa Marta , in northern Colombia , the most extraordinary .
descendants of the old tyrannical civilization , which the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia populated and which was subsequently conquered , moved to the land of the people , an isolated volcanic massif , which was above the Caribbean coastal plain .
in a bloodstained continent , these were people who were the only ones who never were taken by the Spaniards .
until the present day , you will be guided by a ritual priesthood that will lead to formation as a priesthood , but it is very extraordinary .
the young acolyths are found at the age of three and four years by their families . they are separated from each other in a shadowy world of darkness , in stone huts at the foot of the glaciers , for 18 years , and two periods of nine years , deliberately chosen to spend the nine months of pregnancy that they had in their womb , spent in their womb . now they are metamorphically in the womb of the great mother .
and while this is all over , they &apos;re culturally going to be included in the values of their society , values that maintain the claim that their prayers , and only their prayers , the cosmic , or we could say , maintain the ecological balance .
on the end of this amazing initiation , you will suddenly be taken out one day and taken to the outside for the first time in your life , at the age of 18 , you will see a sunrise , and in this crystal clear moment of consciousness , the first light , when the sun begins to rise on the slopes of the amazingly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything you learned in abstract becomes amazing in splendor , confirmed and confirmed by the priest resigns .
and says , &quot; Look , it &apos;s really like I &apos;m telling you .
it &apos;s like that wonderful , you have to protect it .
they call themselves the older brothers , and they say that we &apos;re the ones we &apos;re the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world , we &apos;re responsible .
now , this level of intuition is going to be very important .
always when we think about natives and landscapes , we conjure up either Rousseau and the city of old rumour of noble wild heralds , which are in its simplification a racist thought , or on the other hand Thoreau and say , &quot; These people are more connected to nature than we are . &quot;
so natives are neither sentimental nor sentimental , nor are they being influenced by nostalgia .
it remains not much space for it to be found in the malaria @-@ contaminated swamps of Asmat or the cold winds of Tibet . however , they have nevertheless been destroyed by time and ritual , a mysterious nimbus of the earth that is not based on the idea of being consciously close to her , but on a far more subtle intuition of the idea that the Earth itself can exist only because it can exist in the human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a small child is born of the Andes , who is born in faith that the mountain is a spirit of APU that is his or her destiny . a child who is quite different will become a person and a different relationship to this resource or place . it &apos;s a little child from Montana who is born in the faith , that a person is a mountain , a pile of stones that are to be removed .
whether he is a residence of a spirit or a pile of brass , is irrelevant .
this interesting thing is the metaphor that the relationship between the two individuals and the nature is defined .
I grew up in the woods of British Columbia , and I believed that these forests were going to be there , rounded , and I thought , &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to be in the woods of British Columbia .
this made me feel like another guy , other than my friends , among the Kwakiutl , who believe that these forests are the whereabouts of Hukuk and the curved beak of heaven and cannibal spirits . these are the ones that are on the north end of the world , spirits that they would participate in their Hamatsa initiation .
now , if you start to understand the idea that these are cultures that have created different realities , you can create some of their extraordinary discoveries , for example , this plant here .
it &apos;s a photo that I &apos;ve just taken last April in the northwest of the Amazon .
this is ayahuasca of the many who have been heard by many of you , the strongest psychoactive drug from the repertoire of the shaman .
what Ayahuasca did so fascinating is that it &apos;s not just the pharmacological potential of this preparation , but the processing of it . it &apos;s really made from two different sources , on the one hand , there &apos;s this wooden liane that &apos;s a series of beta @-@ carbolines , harmine , harmolin , slightly hallucinogen , which is just to take this climbing plant , is about as if a blue turmoil smoke is on its consciousness , but it &apos;s going
with the name Psychotria viridis mixed up .
this plant contains some very strong , tryptamins that are similar to serotonin , dimethyltryptamin @-@ 5 and methoxydimethyltryptamine .
if you have ever seen the Yanomami , you can see how she can snuff this stuff , this substance that she can extract from different kinds , also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine .
this powder to snuff is about a bit like it &apos;s from a gun run to be shot , lined with baroque paintings and landing on the ground of a sea of electricity . it &apos;s not going to create distortion of reality , but the dissolution of reality .
I have even talked to my professor Richard Evan Shultes , who is the man who has the psychedelic Area with the discovery of magical fungi in Mexico in the 1930s , in the 1930s , about it . I claimed that you can use these tryptamins not as hallucinogen . because in the 1930s , at the moment you &apos;re seeing the effects , you can &apos;t feel there anymore , you &apos;re around to experience hallucination
since they are protected by a human intestine naturally occurring enzyme , with names of monoamine oxidase , denaturated .
they can only be used in conjunction with some other chemicals orally . they can be taken in order to denaturate the MAO .
now , the fascinating thing is that the beta @-@ carbolines that are contained in the liane are Mao inhibitors of exactly the kind that &apos;s necessary to make the tryptamins that potenate questions . so , ask yourself .
how can these people come from a flora of 80 000 species of astringent plants ? these two morphologically non @-@ related plants can be found , which , if combined in this way , are a kind of biochemical version , so that the whole thing is larger than the sum of its parts .
we use this great euphemism , trying and mistake , which is what is turned out to be meaningless .
but ask me , the Indians say , &quot; They say , &quot; The plant is talking to us .
so what does that mean ?
this tribe , the Cofan , have 17 variants at Ayahuasca , which they all have at great distance in the forest , which are for our eyes considered to be a kind of thing .
and then I &apos;m asking them , &quot; How do you explain your taxonomy , &quot; and they &apos;re saying , &quot; I thought you understand something about plants .
I mean , you know , nothing at all , and I said , &quot; No .
so it &apos;s a question of the fact that you can see each of the 17 variants on full moon , and they sing to one in different pitches .
now , that brings you no PhD in Harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than Stamina counting . well , the problem , the problem is that even those who are among us who have sympathy for the difficult situation of the natives , they &apos;re as original and colorful , but they somehow look at the past as limited to the past , while the real world , that is , our world , is progressing .
so , the fact is that you &apos;re going to look at the 20th century in 300 years , not for its wars or technical innovations , but rather for its wars or technical innovations , but rather for an era in which we were present , and the massive destruction of biodiversity and cultural diversity on Earth , either actively supported or passively accepted , so the problem is not change .
all cultures have changed , time and again , to dance with new possibilities of life .
and that problem is not the problem of technology itself .
the Sioux Indians did not stop any less in being Sioux than they bowed and arrow . tasks as the Americans did stop . Americans stopped being Americans when they were horse and horse @-@ drawn cars .
not change and technology threaten the world &apos;s integrity . it &apos;s not power , it &apos;s the ugly face of domination .
and where , anyway , you can &apos;t get into the world , you &apos;ll discover that these cultures don &apos;t belong to the demise , this is dynamic living peoples , whose existence is characterized by recognizable forces that drive beyond the powers that they have to adapt , whether it &apos;s the doom , the monstrous deforestation in their home country , the Penan , a nomadic people from Southeast Asia , Sarawak , a people who came out of Sarawak ,
and now to bondage and prostitution , to the riverbank , was humiliated from where you see that you can see that even the river with the mud is being polluted , which is almost half Borneo , into the South China Sea , seems to float away from where the Japanese freighters are seen on the horizon , ready to see their ship rooms filled with raw tree trunks that they have taken from the forest , or , in the case of the Yanomami .
where it is pathogens that are present during the Gulf Rush ,
or if we &apos;re going to go up the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m looking for a lot of stuff , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of political dominance .
know , you know , the genocide , the physical extinction of people , is generally condemned , but the ethnocide , the destruction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not condemned , but generally and widely celebrated as part of a development strategy .
and they can &apos;t understand Tibet &apos;s suffering . if they &apos;re not , they can &apos;t understand it at the lowest level .
I traveled to the city with a young colleague , 6000 miles from Chengdu in western China , across the country from Southeast Tibet to Lhasa , and only when I came to Lhasa did I see the face behind the statistics , which you hear 6000 holy monuments that are in debris and ashes turned into 1 / 2 million people , who were killed during the Cultural Revolution by the cadres .
the Father of this young man was born as a follower of the Panchen Lama .
this meant that he was not able to escape immediately during the Chinese invasion .
his uncle fled with her holiness . in the diaspora , the people fled to Nepal , and they were taken to Nepal .
his mother was detained when he was punished for the crime . wealthy people were arrested .
he was born at the age of two in the prison . he was smuggled to get under her skirt to hide , because she was not able to live without him .
the sister , who had done this brave act , was taken to an educational camp .
one day , she stepped out of the box accidentally on a Maos bracelet , and for this transgression , she had to go into a heavy labour camp for seven years .
this suffering of Tibet can be unbearable , but the redeeming spirit of people is something that is unforgettable .
and on the end , we &apos;re really facing an election , and if we want to be in a monochromatic world of monotony or a polychromatic world of diversity .
Margaret Mead : the Great Anthropologist said before she died that she had her greatest fear of being the most serious victim of the fact that , as we move towards a thread of uncreative generic worldview , we &apos;re not only moving across the entire spectrum of human imagination to a narrowed way of thinking , but we &apos;re going to be awakening one day from a dream and forgetting that there &apos;s ever been other possibilities .
and it &apos;s humiliating to be able to think that our genus might have been living for 600,000 years .
the Neolithic Revolution , which gave us agriculture , and which brought us to the world at this moment , the cult of seed grain , the poetry of the shaman , through the prose of the priesthood , replaced and created hierarchy , specialization and surplus , found only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world , as we see it , is hardly 300 years old .
now , this superficial story tells me not that we all know how to respond to the challenges that we face in the coming millennia .
if we want to see these countless world cultures , according to the meaning of humanity , they answer with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to rediscover the possibility of being what we &apos;re , people with full potential consciousness , who are aware of the importance of the fact that all people and gardens have a space to flourish , can be assured , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photo that I &apos;m taking on the northern end of the Baffin Islands when I was going to go hunting with Inuits on Narwhal , and this man , Olaya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the Canadian government is not always the most good at dealing with the Inuit , and while the 1950s were in the process of establishing our own rule , they were forced to move to settlements .
the grandfather of this old man refused to .
the family , the fear of being alive , took him to all arms and all the tools he needed .
now we have to know that the Inuit is not afraid of the cold . they &apos;re using it to their own advantage .
the slide rails of their sled were originally made of fish , which was wrapped in caricature skin .
the grandfather of the man was afraid not of the Arctic . night or night , or the storm .
he slipped to the outside , left his pants out of seal fur and defeated them into his hand , and when the feces freeze , they formed a form in his hand , and he made them into a knife .
he sprayed saliva on the sides of the sewage knife , and when it was completely frozen , he struck a dog with it .
he skinned the dog and improvised the dog &apos;s dishes , took the skeleton of the dog , and improvised a sledge , stretched another dog on , and vanished over the ice floes with the fecal knife on the belt .
so you can get out of nothing , and this is what you can do in many ways , a symbol of resistance from the Inuit and all the natives in the world .
the Canadian government gave the Inuit a new initiative in April 1999 , which was fully controlled by an area larger than the one in California and Texas , together .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called Nunavut .
it &apos;s a independent area , it &apos;s controlling all mineral deposits .
a remarkable example of how a nation , a state , can make reparation with its inhabitants and reach them .
and finally , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are going to go to these distant goals of the Earth , to realize that they &apos;re not far away at all .
they are the home countries of someone .
they represent parts of human imagination . they represent parts of human imagination that go back to past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the geography of hope .
what we do at National Geographic eventually try is that we &apos;re thinking that politicians never ever have anything to achieve .
we believe that polemics , we believe that polemics are not convincing . but we believe that polemics tell stories to the world can change , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in history , in the world . our website receives 35 million hits every month .
156 nations send our TV channel .
our magazines are published by millions of people .
and we do a number of things that we do in the ethnosphere where we can make our audience places of interest from such cultural wonders . we do a number of trips that we see blinded by what we see , and hopefully they will be one by one , the central revelation of anthropology , that this world has earned it in various ways to exist , that we have a way of life in a truly multicultural , pluralistic world .
and when the wisdom of all is revealed to us in our common well @-@ being .
thank you .
I &apos;m going to give you some things out of my book that deal with other things , that you &apos;ve heard about , and try to make connections if you &apos;ve not noticed them .
I would like to start with what I call official dogma .
this official dogma of what ?
the official belief of all Western countries is :
this official dogma is : if you have our goal of maximizing the welfare of our citizens , then this is done above all by maximizing the maximum freedom of individuals .
the reason for this is that freedom is at the heart of itself valuable , meaningful and essential for the human being .
if people want freedom , then it &apos;s everyone of us who &apos;s self @-@ employed to do things that are our common good maximizing , and nobody has to decide for us .
the way to freedom maximize is to choose between maximize choices .
the more choices people have , the more freedom and the more freedom the people have . the more common good they have .
this is , I think , so deep within us that we have no one in the sense of being able to make it into question .
and it &apos;s also deep in the world &apos;s lives .
I give you some examples of what we &apos;re doing today , what we &apos;re doing is making modern progress .
this is my supermarket , not a big one .
only a short while to salad dressings .
it &apos;s 175 dressings in my own supermarket , if you want to see the 10 different native olive oils not counting , and 12 balsamic vinegar varieties that you could buy to buy a large number of your own salad dessings , in the unlikely case that you don &apos;t have one of the 175 in the store .
so this is how the supermarket works .
then we go to a electronics store to buy a stereo system , a loudspeaker , a CD player , a cassette recorder , a radio amplifier , and in this one electronics store , there are so many stereo systems .
we can get 6.5 million different types of stereo systems , from the components that are included in this business .
they must admit that this is a great selection .
in other areas , the world of communication .
it was a time when I was a boy , because I got a lot of telephone service that you wanted to do as long as he came from Ma Bell .
you rented the phone and bought it .
as a result of this , the phone was never broken .
this is a day away .
we have now almost one infinite number of choices of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
this is the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is the one in the middle MP3 player , nasal hair trimmer and crème @-@ brû<unk> flambierer .
and should you not do that until now ? in your own business , you are not sure . be sure that you will soon .
it brings people to live in the shops . and it &apos;s this question that they ask .
do you know the answer to this question ?
the answer is no .
it &apos;s impossible to use a mobile phone to buy that doesn &apos;t do too much .
for other areas of life , which are much more important than shopping , the same goes for the explosion of choices .
health care in the United States is it not longer the case that the health care sector is going to the doctor , and he &apos;s telling you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor and the doctor says to you , &quot; We could do a or b . &quot;
a : has these advantages and risks ?
B ) Has these advantages and risks , what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; Doctor , what should I do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; A has these advantages and risks and B has those benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; If you were me , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
and the doctor says , &quot; But I &apos;m not you .
this is the result of patient autonomy , which sounds like a good thing , but it shifts the burden of responsibility for the meeting of patients &apos; decisions , of someone who knows something , that is , from the doctor to someone who knows nothing and is most likely ill , and therefore not in the best condition to decide , namely the patient .
it &apos;s a huge marketing for the prescription drugs for people who like you and me , what if you think about it , you don &apos;t make sense because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do you advertise us when we don &apos;t buy ?
because they expect that we can do the doctor closest morning , and they can call to make a change in the prescription .
something like this , as profound as our identity , is now a question of choice , how this film should show .
we inherit no identity , we invent it .
and we invent ourselves in this way so often as we want .
D : so every day , when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , it was once the standard assumption that almost everyone had one , and one married so quickly and got so fast children as one could .
the only true choice was who was not , when and not what they were doing afterwards .
today , everything is easy to have .
I teach wonderfully intelligent students and students , and I give them 20 percent less work than before .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart or because they &apos;re less careful .
but because they &apos;re with other things , they &apos;re asking questions about themselves , &quot; Should I marry or not ? &quot; now .
or later , I &apos;m supposed to have kids , or I &apos;m going to make a career .
the two are all engaging questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , even if they &apos;re not doing their tasks and they &apos;re not going to have a good grade in my course .
and they should be doing this in fact . that &apos;s what &apos;s important to answer questions .
work , we are blessed , as Carl has pointed out , with technology that allows us to take every minute , every day , from every place on the planet to work , except for the Randolph Hotel .
it &apos;s actually a corner of the world that I don &apos;t tell you about , where the WLAN works .
I say nothing , I &apos;m using it .
this incredible freedom of choice in the field of work , decisions on making , re @-@ and @-@ making and re @-@ working , whether we should work or not .
we can &apos;t help our kids in football , watch with our mobile phone on one side of the hip and our BlackBerry on other hip and our laptop , probably on our lap .
and also , if you turn off all of them every minute in which we give our child a mutilation of a football game , we ask ourselves , &quot; Should I call this ? &quot;
the email answers the letter , write .
and also , although the answer to the question &quot; No &quot; is , it will change your experience from your child &apos;s football game , very differently than it would have been .
everywhere , where we look , large and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world in which we live , saw so much of it .
so I want to say that there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world in which we live now is seeing so much of it .
and the question is , are these good or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we know that what &apos;s good about it , so I &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
all these choices have two effects : two negative effects on the people .
a effect of paradoxical ways is that it paralyses , instead of liberating .
with such many options from the world of choice , you can choose from , people are very hard to decide at all .
I &apos;m going to give you another drastic example of this : a study on investment in voluntary retirement provision .
a colleague of mine had access to the investment files of Vanguard , the giant fund company of about one million employees , and about 2000 different jobs .
and what they found was per cent 10 investment funds that the employer offered , and the participation was increased by 2 percent .
they offer 50 investment funds , 10 percent less employees , take part than if they were just 5 percent offering them . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 investment funds , which are available to choose from , it &apos;s so hard to decide which one to choose from , that they &apos;ll postpone it tomorrow .
and then tomorrow and then tomorrow , and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow , of course , never comes .
understand the fact that this is not just that people are dog food , if they eat in the retirement , they have to eat because they don &apos;t have enough money to go back , it also means making decisions , so hard is that they have great investment opportunities for their employers to miss .
by the non @-@ participation , you give up to $ 5000 per year on from $ 5,000 from the employer who has been happy to make your contribution to increase .
paralysis is a consequence of a disease that has too many choices .
and I think it &apos;s a matter of making the world look like this : you want to make the decision really right when it comes to all eternity , right ?
they want not to know the wrong investment fund or even to choose the wrong salad dressing .
so , that &apos;s one effect . the other effect is the other effect , even if we &apos;re going to overcome paralysis and make a decision , we end up less satisfied with the outcome of selection than when we have the opportunity to get between us less opportunities and choose between .
and it &apos;s a number of reasons for this .
one of them is conditioned by the fact that there are a wide range of salad dressings when you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect , and what salad dressing is perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that you &apos;re making a different decision .
also , although there is a good decision .
the more opportunities it has , the easier it is to make nothing at all regretting the fact that it is disappointing for the election you make .
secondly , what economists call oppertunity costs .
Dan Gilbert has a great point . today , this morning , he told us how much the way in which the way we evaluate things is depends on what we &apos;re going to compare it .
well , if it &apos;s very many alternatives to think about , it &apos;s easy to get attractive features , of alternatives that you exclude , of which it makes you less satisfied with alternatives that you have chosen .
here &apos;s a sample of the kind of things you don &apos;t know of as New York , and I apologize .
but here &apos;s what you would have thought .
here &apos;s a couple of on the Hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach , great day . you have it all for yourself .
what could be better ? damn .
the man thinks it &apos;s August , every one in my Manhattan neighborhood is gone .
I could go straight ahead of my house .
and he spends 2 weeks of time from the thought , persecuting that he has missed the opportunity to go day by day , a great parking lot .
oppertunity costs reduce satisfaction , which we have achieved through our selection , even if what we do choose is fantastic .
and the more opportunities it offers to choose from , the more attractive properties of this selection will be in the oppertunity costs .
here &apos;s a further example .
now , this cartoon makes some statements .
he makes a statement about this in the now living and living , and perhaps about things slowly , doing things .
but a major point that he has made is always who he &apos;s going to be for one thing to decide on . you &apos;re not going to do other things , and these other things like many attractive properties , and it &apos;s going to be what you &apos;re going to do , making it less attractive .
thirdly , escalation of expectations .
this has made me meet when I saw my jeans exchange .
I am wearing jeans almost all over the time .
and it was a time when there was a time when there was only jeans of a kind , and they bought them , and they got a bad fit , they were incredibly uncomfortable , and if they had worn them long enough , and they had often washed enough , they started feeling OK .
so I went to make new jeans to buy , after many years of wearing the old and I said , &quot; I &apos;d like to have a couple of jeans . &quot; here &apos;s my size .
and the seller said , &quot; Do you want to have slender , slightly lying , or wide ? &quot;
do you want to use buttons or zipper , stone or acid washed ?
do you want to wear jeans with holes ?
do you want to cut down wide , tapered blah blah blah and so on ? he told .
my jaw was down and after I was sitting back , I said , &quot; I would like to have the kind that used to be the only way .
he had no idea what the world was , so I spent a hour doing it all , so all these damn jeans were trying out and drank the business , and I say the truth with the best jeans I ever could have .
I had it better to do all this selection , and I was better able to have it .
but I felt like I was worse .
why I wrote a whole book ? to get to try it to me to explain it to myself .
the reason for this is that I &apos;m feeling worse was with all these available options . my expectations for what I &apos;m looking for for for a good pair of jeans went up .
I had a very low expectation , I had no concrete expectations when it came to just seeing them in a way .
as they were in 100 species , damn a man of them , would have been perfect .
and what I got was good . but it was not good , it was not perfect .
and so I compared what I did get . to what I did , I looked forward to , and what I had , was disappointing compared to what I expected .
this is because adding options to the life of people increases the inevitably the expectations that people have . people have about how well these opportunities are going to be .
and this leads to less satisfaction . the results also lead to less satisfaction , even if the results are good .
nobody in the world of marketing is aware of this .
because if you don &apos;t know , you would all know what it &apos;s all about .
the truth is more like the truth here .
the reason is that , in the past , everything was better than anything worse than everything worse than anything worse . was it worse for people to experience ? that a pleasant and pleasant surprise .
today , in the world , in which we live , we &apos;re wealthy industrialized citizens with perfection , expecting the best for the one you ever hope for , is that things are so good as they &apos;re .
they will never be pleasantly surprised because their expectations are my expectations high .
this mystery to happiness , that &apos;s what you &apos;re all coming for , the secret to happiness , are low expectations .
I would like to say a short autobiographical moment that I &apos;ve been able to marry with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
I would have not been better off if I had not done it .
but let down is not always the case .
ultimately , a consequence of buying a poorly @-@ seated jeans when it &apos;s just a kind of buying , is that there &apos;s a discontent when you &apos;re dissatisfied and you &apos;re wondering why who &apos;s responsible for answering the answer is clear .
the world is responsible for what would you have done ?
if hundreds of different species of species of jeans are available and you buy a one that disappointing is and you can ask why who is who responsible ?
is it just as clear that the answer to the question of the question is you ?
they would have done better to make it .
with 100 different species of jeans , in the shop window , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , when people make decisions and make decisions , and even when the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about it . they accuse themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world . in the last few generations .
I believe that a significant , not the only , but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression and also a suicide is that people are experiencing that people who have been disappointing because their standards are so high and then they are when they get these experiences themselves to explain themselves , they think it would be their fault .
and so it &apos;s the balance sheet that it &apos;s generally better for us to be objective , and we feel worse .
so let &apos;s just let you remember .
this is the official dogma that has created one that we all want to think is right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
it &apos;s not a question of something that &apos;s a little choice better than no one , but it &apos;s not going to follow the more choice , better than something that &apos;s choice .
it &apos;s a magical amount . I know not what it &apos;s like .
I am very much sure that I am not sure that we have missed this point for a long time , in which we have improved our common good .
now , as a principle , I &apos;m almost finished as a matter of principle , question , the thing to think about is what &apos;s all these choices allow , in the industrialized societies , is what material is wealth .
it &apos;s a lot of places in the world , and we &apos;ve got a lot of them who have not heard about the problem of too large a selection .
your problem is that you &apos;re going to have too little .
so the things about the one I &apos;m talking about are a weird problem of the modern rich western societies .
and what is so frustrating and so annoying is Steve Levitt . did you tell them yesterday that this expensive and expensive and hard to fix child seats don &apos;t help ?
this is a waste of money .
I &apos;m telling you that these expensive , complicated decisions , it &apos;s not just that the fact that they &apos;re not helping .
they do not hurt .
they worry about the fact that we &apos;re worse off .
if some of the things that people in our society make choices , in societies , would be postponed , in societies where people have too little choice , not only does life improve for people , but for our dignity , but also improves . economists call this a pareto @-@ improvement application .
income redistribution is going to make sure that everyone is better off , not just the poor , because all this great selection is plaguing us .
finally , read the following cartoon : and a sophisticated person , &quot; Ah , what knows this fish ? &quot;
they know it &apos;s not possible to do anything in this goldfish glass .
impoverished fantasy , a short @-@ sighted view of the world , and that &apos;s the way I first read it .
the more I &apos;m talking about it , the more I came to the view that the more fish were aware of it .
because the truth is that if you know that the goldfish glass is broken , everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom , you have paralysis .
if you like the goldfish glass , so that everything is possible , lower the satisfaction of the fish .
they increase the paralysis and lower the risk of satisfaction .
everyone needs a goldfish glass .
this is certainly a too limited , perhaps also for the fish , but definitely for us .
but the lack of a metaphorical goldfish glass is a recipe for misery and I suspect that catastrophe .
thank you .
