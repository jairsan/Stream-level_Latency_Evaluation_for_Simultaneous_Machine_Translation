last year , I made these two slides to illustrate that I &apos;ve seen the Arctic ice cap that &apos;s going to last for nearly three million years , the size of the bottom 48 states , shrunk by 40 percent .
but this does not express enough seriousness of this particular problem . because it is not the thickness of the ice , it does not show .
in a sense , the Arctic ice cap is the beating heart of our global climate system .
it grows in winter and shrinks in summer .
the next slide I &apos;m showing you is a time lapse shot , which has been going on over the last 25 years .
the continuous ice is marked with red .
as you can see , it grows on the dark blue , marked this is the annual ice in winter , and it shrinks in summer .
the so @-@ called &quot; Dauereis &quot; , five years old or older , is almost like blood flowing out of the body here .
in 25 years it will be from here to here gone .
this is a problem because warming is causing the frozen reason to the Arctic Ocean to emerge , where there are large amounts of frozen carbon . what if it comes up from microbes , it &apos;s converted to methane ?
compared to the total amount of climate @-@ changing substances in the atmosphere , this figure could double if we were to take this critical point .
even today , in some shallow lakes in Alaska , methane is bubbling by itself from the water .
Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska is also working with another working group on another flat lake . last winter .
video : WOW al Gore , you &apos;re doing well , the question is , how will we be ?
and one reason is this enormous heat storage system is warming Greenland from the north .
this is an annual dew water flow .
but the volumes are much larger than ever before .
this is the Kangerlussuaq River in southwest Greenland .
if you want to know how sea level rises through land ice melting , here it flows into the sea .
these rivers are growing rapidly .
at the other end of the planet , Antarctica , the largest ice mass on the planet .
last month , researchers reported that the entire continent is now experiencing a negative ice balance .
and the West Antarctica , which has emerged over a few underwater islands , is particularly strong in melting .
this corresponds to 20 feet above sea level , just like Greenland .
in the Himalayas , the third largest ice mass , you can see new lakes that were glaciers a few years ago .
40 percent of all people in the world get half of their drinking water from this melting water .
in the Andes , this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city .
the amounts of water have increased .
but if they seal , most of the drinking water will also fall away .
in California , a 40 % reduction in the snow cover of the Sierra was seen .
this concerns the storage tanks .
and the predictions of how you read them are serious .
this drying up all over the world leads to a dramatic increase in fires .
and the disasters everywhere in the world have been in a really extraordinary and unprecedented situation .
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 .
this is a completely untenable pattern of development .
if you like this in the historical context , you can see what it &apos;s doing .
in the last 5 years , we &apos;ve been producing 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours , 25 million tons every day , in the oceans .
look at the area of the Eastern Pacific , from the American continent to the west and on both sides of the Indian subcontinent , where there is a drastic decline in oxygen in the oceans .
the biggest single factor for global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning down fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the biggest problem .
the United States is one of the two largest polluters , along with China .
and the proposal was to create many more coal factories .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
here are the ones that have been deleted in recent years , with some green alternatives that have been proposed .
but there is a political struggle in our country .
and the coal industries and oil industries have spent a quarter of a billion dollars last year to apply clean coal , which is in itself a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me of something .
around Christmas , I ran home at home in Tennessee , where I had a billion tons of coal sludge .
you probably have it in the news .
this is in our country the second largest waste flow in America .
this happened around Christmas .
one of the commercials of the coal industry around Christmas was this .
frosty : the carbarian is a happy , happy guy .
he is in the fullness of his life in America , and he helps our economy to grow .
frosty : the carboniferous man gets cleaner every day .
it &apos;s affordable and adorable , and workers stay in wages and bread .
al Gore : this is the source of most coal in West Virginia .
the most powerful miner is the leader of Massey Coal .
video : don Blankenship - Let me make one thing clear : al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid - you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
al Gore : so the Alliance for Climate Protection has launched two campaigns .
this is part of her .
video actor at the Coalergy . we see climate change as a serious threat to our business .
that is why we have made it the top line : a considerable amount of money to spend on advertising , and we have to get the truth about coal .
the fact is , coal is not dirty .
we believe it &apos;s clean and smells of good .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
leave it to us quietly .
video Actor Saueber Kohle : you have heard a lot of that .
so let &apos;s take a tour of these modern , clean coal factories .
fantastic , this machine is pretty noisy .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
and yet , burning coal , one of the main reasons for global warming , is remarkable clean coal technology that they &apos;re seeing here , changes everything .
look at it exactly . this is the current clean coal technology .
al Gore : finally the positive alternative mixes with our economic challenge and our challenge of the national security .
video narrator : America is in crisis , the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that connects all of these is our dependence on carbon @-@ based fuels , like dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now there &apos;s a brave new solution to get us out of this miserable situation .
supply America with 100 percent clean electricity , new within the next 10 years .
a Plan to America Back to Work - To Make us safer and safer and to help us to reduce global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
supply America New ! find out more !
al Gore : this is the last .
video narrator : it &apos;s about resupplying America .
one of the fastest ways to reduce our dependence on old dirty fuels that suffocate our world .
man : the future is here : wind , sun and a new energy system .
man No. 2 : new investments to create well @-@ paid jobs
narrator : &quot; resupply America . it &apos;s time to accept reality . &quot;
al Gore : there &apos;s an old African proverb : &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone . &quot;
if you want to get far , go together .
we must get far , fast .
thank you .
on the last TED conference , I gave an introduction to the LHC .
and I promised to come back to tell them how the world &apos;s machine works .
now it &apos;s time for everyone to come and for those who didn &apos;t come back then . the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever to be tackled . 27 kilometers in diameter .
his task is to understand the conditions that are less than one billionth of a second after the beginning of the universe , and that are up to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking , ambitious .
this is the machine below Geneva .
we take pictures of these mini Big Bang in detectors .
I work on this , he &apos;s called Atlas Detector , 44 meters wide , 22 meters wide , in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction so you can see the size .
on September 10 last year , the machine ran for the first time .
and this picture was taken by Atlas .
it caused immense cheering in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first particle of radiation that &apos;s going to cover the entire route around the LHC , then deliberately collided with part of the LHC to get a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we took this picture on September 10 , we knew that the machine was working , which was a great triumph .
I don &apos;t know if this is the greatest cheering , or if this is someone who visited Google and visited the home page .
it means that we have a cultural influence , alongside the scientific achievements .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that was connected to these wires here . this problem was this golden wires here .
these wires are 13 thousand amps when the machine runs at high performance .
now the engineers , among them , you &apos;re going to look at them and say , &quot; No , you &apos;re not doing that . &quot; these are small wires .
you can do that because if you do it very far , you &apos;re going to cool it down to so @-@ called superconductors .
at minus 271 degrees , that is , colder than the space between the stars , these wires can withstand the tension .
in one of the connections between over nine thousand magnets in the LHC , there was a manual defect .
this makes the wires slightly heated and 13 thousand amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance .
this was the result .
well , all this is even more impressive if you imagine that the magnets are about 20 tons , and they &apos;re about 30 cm shifted around .
so we damaged about 50 percent of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we did .
we conditioned them , repaired them .
they are all back on their way back .
towards the end of March , the LHC will be operational again .
we will turn it on and expect first data in June or July to be collected and we will continue our journey to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
well , of course , in a way , such accidents are once again igniting the debate about the value of science and engineering at such borders . it &apos;s easy to reject this .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to understand the fact that we &apos;re crossing our borders is the way we value things like the one that &apos;s LHC .
I will make my final words to an English scientist , Humphrey Davy , who , as I suspect , when he was the defenders of his apprentice &apos;s useless experiments , was Michael Faraday , saying , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind to assume that our scientific ideas are definitive , that there are no mysteries in nature , that our triumphs are full of numbers , and that there are no new worlds to conquer . &quot;
thank you .
I want to start by asking you to go back to the time you were childhood , when you played with blocks of blocks .
while they realized how to stretch out your hands and grab the blocks and move , they learned to actually think about and solve problems by taking understanding and changing spatial space connections .
spatial thinking is close to how the world is doing much of our environment .
as an informatics scientist inspired by the way we interact with real objects , together with my specialist advisor Patti and my colleague Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to wonder , &quot; What if we were to use computers that were to be used instead of a mouse pointer that was like a digital finger tip on a flat worksurface ? what if we were to intervene with both hands and physically grab data ? &quot;
and they could arrange as we did .
this question was so gripping that we were going to explore the answer and to develop siftables .
in short , a siftable is an interactive computer in the size of a biscuit .
you can use your hand to move , you can perceive each other , you can move , you can capture your movements , and you have a screen and a radio receiver .
much more important are physical , which is why , like building blocks , they are only allowed to move through stretching out their hands and accessing .
and the siftables are an example of a new generation of tools for manipulating digital data .
and if these aids become more physical and a consciousness of their movements , each other realize each other , and the fineness of our handling them , then we can be connected to the exploration of new and entertaining interaction types .
I &apos;m starting with some simple examples .
this siftable is designed for video playback , and if I want to move it in one direction , the video is played forward when I put it in the other direction , it runs backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other .
if I put them side by side , then you &apos;re arousing interest .
if you are surrounded by one @-@ wire , you notice that , and you can become nervous .
and they feel their movements and their inclination .
an interesting consequence of the interactions that we began to recognize was that we had to make everyday gestures on data , such as colors , how to pour them out , how to do it with liquids .
in this case , we have three siftables configured as color pots , and I can use them to color the color in the middle to pour where they then mixed up .
if we can exaggerate it , we can pour it back a little .
there are also some nice ways to get into education , such as languages , mathematics , or logic games , where we can give people the chance to try out quickly and see the results immediately .
here I am , this is a Fibonacci episode that I &apos;ve been creating with a simple equation program .
this is a game with words that have a kind of mixture of scrabble and boggle .
basically , you get every round on any siftable random assigned letter , and while you try to make words , these are written through a dictionary .
then after about 30 seconds , it &apos;s mixed again , and you &apos;ve got a new combination of letters and new ways to try out .
thank you .
these are some children who are on a trip to the Media Lab . I could make them do it and try it out , and I recorded a video of it .
you really loved it .
an interesting fact about this type of application is that you can tell people not many instructions .
all you have to say is , &quot; Make words , &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here are a few people who have tried it .
that &apos;s our youngest beta tester down there on the right .
it turned out that he was the siftables just stacking .
so for him , they were just building blocks .
this is an interactive animation .
we wanted to use a language learning tool .
that &apos;s Felix .
he can create new characters in the scene by playing the siftable from the table , which takes this figure .
here he lets the sun rise .
now he &apos;s picking up a tractor in the scene .
good work , yes .
by making the siftables shake and they put them side by side , he can let the characters interact .
his own story inventing .
it &apos;s a story with an open end , and it can decide how it develops .
the last example I have time to give today is to show it , a music sequencer for live performances that we &apos;ve recently developed , and in which Siftables are called sounds like leadership voice , bass and drums .
each has four different variations . you can choose which one you want to use .
and you can see these sounds in the sequence that you can put into any pattern , and you can sort them in any pattern .
and they feed them by simply simply putting a sound @-@ siftable on a sequence @-@ siftable .
there are effects that you can change live , such as Hall and Filter .
you connect it to a certain tone and tend to turn it into a setting .
and then , more generally , effects like tempo and volume that you can see on the whole sequence .
so let &apos;s look .
we start in which we have the lead voice fed into two sequence siftable , and we order it in a number of ways , they expand it , and add a little bit more of the voice .
now I &apos;m adding a bass .
now I &apos;m going to do some more stuff about it .
and now I connect the filter to the drums so that I can see the effect live .
I can &apos;t speed up the whole sequence by moving the pace into one or the other direction .
and now I connect the filter to the bass for something else .
I can &apos;t see the sequence as it runs .
so I don &apos;t have to plan them in advance , but I can improvise , while extending or shortening them .
and finally , I can hide the whole sequence by reading the volume @-@ siftable to the left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my enthusiasm is to create new human computer interfaces that are better suited to how our brains and bodies work .
and today I had time to give you some of this new design world , and some of the ways we could show what we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the idea I &apos;ve been thinking of on the way is that the idea we &apos;re going to be on the threshold of this new generation of value witnesses , interacting with digital media that can transmit information into our world that can meet our requirements .
thank you .
I look forward to talking to you all .
I &apos;m a writer .
books to write is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
it &apos;s also my great lifelong love and fascination .
and I don &apos;t expect that ever to change .
but recently , something strange in my life and career has happened , which has led me to think about my relationship to this work completely , and I think it &apos;s a very strange thing .
this strange event was that I recently wrote a book , a biography called Eat Pray , Love , which decided to be different from all my previous books from any reason for some reason , and which was a great mega event , an international bestseller thing .
the result is that I don &apos;t care where I come from , as if I were doomed to doom .
seriously dedicated to the demise .
for example , they are very worried about me and say , &quot; Don &apos;t you fear that you will never exceed this success ? &quot;
don &apos;t be afraid that you can do all your life and never go back to a book that someone in the world can be interested in , never again .
okay , that really makes you brave .
it would be worse , however , if I did not remember that I was over 20 years ago , when I was a teenager for the first time told me that I was going to be a writer , with the same kind of fear @-@ filled reaction .
people said , &quot; Don &apos;t you fear , never succeed ? &quot;
have you not been afraid that humiliation of a rejection will kill you ?
have you not been afraid that you can make your life go on for this craft and never come up with anything from it , and that you die on a scrap pile of burst dreams ? your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failure .
so , you know , you know .
the answer : the short answer to all these questions is yes .
yes , I &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and I always had that .
and I &apos;ve got a lot more fear of things that nobody would ever suspect of , like algae and other terrifying things .
but when it comes to writing , I think about it recently , and I wonder why .
is that reasonable ?
is it logical that someone is expected to expect him to be afraid of getting the job done ? to the point where he &apos;s called to do that ?
and what exactly is the creative business going on , that they &apos;re unsure about the mutual state of mind in a way that &apos;s different from other professions , not doing ?
my father , for example , was a chemist , and I can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist , in which he was asked if he was afraid to be a chemist .
with your chemist blockade John , how are you doing it ?
it just didn &apos;t happen . you know .
but to be fair , the group of chemists have been talking about the centuries , not the reputation of alcoholic , manic @-@ depressive people .
we writers seem to have this kind of reputation , but not just the writers , but the creative minds of all genres seem to have this reputation , mentally incredibly unstable , unstable .
all you need to do is to get the bitter death figures of really great heads out of the 20th century alone , young and often young , and often dying by their own hands .
and even those who don &apos;t actually begin suicide seemed to be really neglected by their talents .
Norman Mailer said shortly before his death in his last interview , &quot; Every one of my books has taken me a little further .
an extraordinary statement that you have about your life &apos;s work .
but we &apos;re not even twitching when we &apos;re saying something like this because we &apos;re listening to this kind of statement for so long , somehow we &apos;ve been thinking of it like that , internalizing it collectively , we &apos;ve accepted creativity and suffering somehow belong together , and art in the end always leads to torment .
the question I have to ask everyone here today is this : is this idea completely for you ?
feel like it .
because with just one centimeter distance , I feel like I &apos;m in the first place not comfortable with this view .
I find them horrible .
and I think they &apos;re dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to watch them take over to the next century .
I think it &apos;s better if we can encourage our great creative people to live .
and I definitely know that it &apos;s a very important thing for me to start in my situation to start this dark path of presumption , so to speak , leaking down , especially in the fact that I &apos;m in my career right now .
that means , you see , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m just about 40 years old .
I may have another 40 years of work in me .
and it &apos;s very likely that all I &apos;ve got from now on to write is from the world as the work that &apos;s being evaluated after the departure success of my last book , right ?
I say it straight out , because we are all here , right now , somehow friends . it &apos;s most likely that my greatest success is behind me .
Oh Jesus , what a thought !
these are the kinds of thoughts that make someone think about it at 9 a.m. Gin Gin is going to drink and that &apos;s what I don &apos;t want .
I would rather continue to do this work that I love .
so the question is , how ?
after some time of reflection , I think I &apos;m going to write to continue writing , a kind of protective psychological construct that I &apos;ve got to design .
somehow I have to get a way from now on , writing a safe distance to keep a safe distance between me and my very natural anxiety about how the response to the written being will be .
while I was in the process of looking for models for this last year to do that , I also have a look at the past , and I &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they might be better or more sensible about it , than we did about how to help creative people to get emotional risks around .
this search led me to ancient Greece and the ancient Rome .
please follow me , because the circle will change again .
but in ancient Greece and Rome , people don &apos;t believe that creativity is the result of people . okay .
they believed creativity was a kind of divine servant spirit that came from a distant , unknown source to people , from inexplicable , unknown reasons .
the Greeks called these divine servants @-@ spirits of creativity demons .
Socrates is aware that he believed that he had a demon , the demon who gave him wisdom from afar .
the Romans had the same idea , called this kind of bodyless , creative spirit , a genius .
that &apos;s great . &quot; the Romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius , a particularly smart individual .
they believed that a genius could use this kind of magical divine being that was believed to be proverbial in the world walls of an artist &apos;s studio , about the same way Dobby , the housemate , would come out of the room and make the artist , in a sense , invisible at work , and would shape the result of the work .
that &apos;s brilliant , there &apos;s it , there &apos;s the distance I talked about , the psychological construct that separates you from the consequences of your work .
and everyone knew that it worked like this , right ?
the artist of antiquity was above all protected , as for example , too much narcissism , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at everything for you , everyone knew you could do this body @-@ less genius that helped you .
if your work didn &apos;t completely flap your mistake , right ?
everyone knew your genius was a bit lame .
so people in the West have really been talking about creativity for a long time .
and then the Renaissance came , and everything changed . we had this great idea , and this great idea was , &quot; Let &apos;s let the human individual go to the center of the universe , to all the gods and mysteries , and there &apos;s no room for mystical creatures anymore , to accept the commands of the Divine . &quot;
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism , and people started to believe that creativity is complete with their own individual .
for the first time in history , people hear this or that artist , a genius , call it , instead of being a genius .
I have to tell you , I think that was a big mistake .
you know , I think to be allowing a mere person to think he or she &apos;s like that vessel , like that basin , and the essence , and the source , of all the divine , creative , unknown , infinite mystery , is a little bit too much responsibility to give it a fragile human psyche .
it &apos;s like asking someone to see the sun swallow .
this distorts and distorts whole ego &apos;s , and it creates all these unattainable expectations of success .
I think that this pressure to succeed , our artists , has destroyed the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , and I think it &apos;s true , the question is :
can we change it ?
maybe to an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of creative return .
maybe not .
maybe we can get the idea from 500 years of rational humanism not just in an 18 @-@ minute talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience who really have legitimate scientific doubts about how to get the idea of basically fairies , people follow people , and fairy @-@ birds on their projects , etc .
I &apos;m probably not going to see all of you take this trip .
but the question I want to raise is , why not ?
why not think about it ?
because it &apos;s just as much sense as anything else I &apos;ve heard of when it comes to the question of making absolutely crazy , capricious the creative process .
a process that , as everyone knows , ever tries to do something about it , so in other words , actually everyone here , not always sensible , is doing it .
in fact , he can sometimes almost paranormal feel .
I recently had such an encounter when I saw the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone , who is now over 90 , who is , but who &apos;s been a poet throughout her life . she told me that when she was in Virginia , she grew up in the village , she was working outside in the fields , she said she would feel and hear a poem about the landscape coming up to her .
she said it was like a thundering train out of air .
the country on which you would roll .
she felt when it came , because it would make the earth under her feet quake .
she knew she was in such a moment only doing one thing , and that was in her words , &quot; Race like the devil . &quot;
she ran like the devil to the house while she was inspired by this poem . it was only about her being quick enough to become a sheet of paper and a pen . so she could get it if it was through her through thunder , catch it and get it on the sheet .
in other paintings , she was not fast enough , she ran and ran and ran , but she reached the house not , and the poem rolled through her and rolled her , and she missed it . she said it would continue to move over land and , as she said , after another poet .
and then there were these moments , and I &apos;ll never forget that part . &quot; she said there were moments when she was almost missing it .
so she runs to the house and looks for the paper , and the poem goes through her and she takes up a pen , just as it goes through her , and then she said , &quot; It was like it was like she was holding her other hand and grabbing it and grabbing it .
she caught the poem on his tail and pulled it back into her body and took over it on the leaf . paper .
on these occasions , the poem came flawlessly and intact on paper . but backwards from the last word to the first .
when I heard that , I thought , &quot; This is scary . &quot; that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is going on .
that &apos;s not like my creative process at all . I &apos;m not the channel .
I &apos;m a mule to be able to work , I have to work every day at the same time , and sweat , I have to work hard and really torment unpleasant .
but even I , in my mule species , sometimes striped this thing .
and I guess many of you think that &apos;s what they did .
even I had work or ideas that came from a source through me , which I really didn &apos;t identify .
what is this thing ?
and how do we relate to this without having to understand our mind , but rather to us , on the contrary , even to mental health ?
for me , the best living example is how to do this , the musician Tom Waits . I was allowed to see him for a few years ago for a magazine .
we talked about this topic and we know what the most important thing about his life was , Tom , the embodiment of tormented modern artist , who tried to make these uncontrollable creative impulses that lived in him , and who lived with them .
but then he got older and quieter , and he told me that one day he was on a highway in Los Angeles , and he changed , and everything changed for him .
he went at high speed when he suddenly saw a small fragment of a melody that sounds like it was often with inspirations , for him tormenting , hard to grasp , and he wants to have it . it &apos;s magnificent . he &apos;s leaking after it , but he can &apos;t grasp it .
he has no paper , he has no pen , he has no cassette recorder .
so it starts this old anxiety in it , like the old one , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose this thing , &quot; and I &apos;m going to be persecuted forever by this song .
I &apos;m not good enough , I &apos;m not able to .
but instead of panic , he heard it just stop .
he finished the whole course of thought and did something completely new .
he just looked into the sky and said , &quot; Excuse me , can &apos;t you see I &apos;m driving a car ? &quot;
I look like I could just see a song writing down .
if you really want to exist , come to a more favorable moment again , if I care about you .
if not tortures , someone else today .
go and torment Leonard Cohen
his entire work process has changed .
not the work itself , which was still often as dark as ever ,
but the process and the heavy grief that surrounds him was lifted when he saw the genius coming out of himself . where he had nothing but trouble , and he had to leave him where he was , so to speak , coming from . he realized that it had to be no internally tormenting thing .
it could be a strange , miraculous , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between Tom and the alien external thing that doesn &apos;t really matter to Tom .
when I heard this story , it also changed a little bit , the way I worked and it has changed me . I &apos;ve saved it .
this idea saved me when I was in the middle of the writing process of Eat Pray Love . I fell into one of these ducts of doubt , into which we all fall when we work on something and it doesn &apos;t work . you catch thinking that it &apos;s a disaster that &apos;s going to make it the worst book ever written .
not only bad , but the worst of all times .
I started thinking , &quot; I should just stamp the project .
but then I remembered how Tom was in the free sky . and then I remembered how Tom was talking to the free sky , and I tried .
so I lifted my gaze from the manuscript and I said my comment towards an empty corner of space .
I said loud , &quot; Hear , you , thing , you , and I both know if this book isn &apos;t brilliant , that it &apos;s not my fault , right ? &quot;
because you see that I &apos;m doing everything I have , I &apos;m not investing more than that .
if you do have better , you have to cross up here and increase your share of the deal .
okay , but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what the hell is doing with it .
I will continue to write , because that &apos;s my job .
and I would ask you to record that I am voting for my part today in favour of the job here .
because in the end , it &apos;s as follows : centuries ago , in the deserts of North Africa , people turned to moonlight festivals with sacred dances and music held for hours , until dawn .
these festivals were always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but now and then , very rarely , something special happened : one of the actors actually became superworldly .
and I know you know what I mean , because I know that you all live in your life , once you &apos;ve seen such a performance .
it was as if the time was standing still and the dancer was passing through a kind of gate , he did nothing but he ever did it before . 1,000 people spent 1,000 nights before , but everything was together .
and suddenly he didn &apos;t appear anymore pure , human .
he was illuminated from within and from below , illuminated and illuminated , all by a divine fire .
and what happened at that time was that people knew what that was . they called it by its name .
they laid hands together and started to sing : &quot; Allah , Allah , God , God , God . &quot;
that &apos;s God . you know .
interesting historical footnote when the Ethiopians conquered southern Spain , they brought this custom to the fore , the debate changed over the centuries from Allah . Allah Allah to Olé Olé Olé Olé , which is still to be seen in bullfights and flamenco dances .
if a performer in Spain is doing something impossible , something magical , Allah Olé Olé Allah , great Bravo , incomprehensible , there it is a volatile look at God .
and that &apos;s great , because we need that .
but the tricky part follows the next morning , when the dancer wakes up and realizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock in a Tuesday , and he &apos;s no longer a little five @-@ bit of God in himself .
he &apos;s just an aging mortal with painful knees , and maybe he &apos;s never going to go back to these heights .
and maybe never again will anyone know God &apos;s name when he turns , but what should he do with the name of the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most painful corrections to a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of pain if you &apos;re not going to believe from the beginning that the most extraordinary aspects of your life would come from you .
if you might just believe that you have a loan from a tremendous source for a very fine time of your life , which is connected to someone else , if you &apos;re done with it .
when we start thinking about it , it changes all .
so I started thinking and so I think I &apos;m sure I &apos;m going to have been thinking in the past few months , working on the book that will soon appear as the dangerous , frightening , greatly awaited successor of my departed success .
what I constantly say to myself when I talk about it crazy is , &quot; Don &apos;t be afraid .
don &apos;t be discouraged , just do your job .
be still responsible for your contribution , whatever he is , whatever .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the stupid divine genius that you have to face is the decision for a short while , a touch of the miracle will be decided by your effort to show you , then Olé .
and if not , dance your dance .
and Olé : for you , despite all this .
I believe that , and I feel that we should teach that .
Olé : for you , despite all this , just for you to be the mere human love and attachment to it , because you have to be .
thank you .
thank you .
June Cohen Olé
you know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome , and what that might mean , and about the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point , and we digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code to a new phase of biology , by moving new life and creating and building new life .
we have always tried to ask important questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something I think many biologists think is trying to understand . and that &apos;s different in different levels .
we have tried different approaches to make it possible to use it to simplify the minimum components .
we have spent nearly 20 years digitizing when we sequenced the human genome , and the change from the analogue world to the biology world to the digital world , the computer , was going to be done .
now we &apos;re trying to ask if we can regenerate lives , or if we can create new life , from this digital universe .
this is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma geitalium , which is the smallest genome of a species that has itself replicated in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to see if we could do this with an even smaller genome .
we managed to get to about one hundred genes out of the 500 or so genes , which are here .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to our trust , you know , I think that &apos;s simple , but if we all look at these genes that we have one by one eliminated , it &apos;s very much unlikely that this will lead to a living cell , but it &apos;s very unlikely .
so we decided that it would be the only way forward . this chromosome is actually the only way to synthesize what allows us to make the individual components vary , and so we could ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started to talk to the question , &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot;
allows chemistry to really make these really big molecules , which is never before done before .
and if we can , we can do that , we can start the chromosome .
a chromosome is just one piece of inert chemical material by the way .
our steps in digitising life were very exponential .
our ability to write genetic code has changed very slowly , but still has increased , and our last point would now be to exhibit an exponential curve .
we started 15 years ago .
it actually took a few years , starting with a bioethical review , before we did the first experiments .
it turns out that DNA synthesization is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that are small pieces of DNA that can make 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a degenerative process , so the longer you make a piece , the more errors happen .
so we had to develop a new method that we could use to compose these little pieces and correct the mistakes .
that was our first attempt , starting with digital information about the genome Phi X 174 .
it &apos;s a small virus that kills bacteria .
we created small pieces , made a bug correction , and we had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we saw this piece of inert chemistry and we went into a bacterium , and the bacterium started to use genetic code to read and make viral particles .
the viral particles were then removed from the cells and returned to the hospital and killed E. coli .
recently , I started talking to the oil industry , and they said that they understood this model exactly .
they laughed more than they were . it &apos;s like this . let &apos;s think that &apos;s a situation where software actually does its own hardware build , in a biological way , in a biological system .
but we wanted to go a lot further , we wanted to have a whole bacterial chromosome built , it has more than 580,000 letters of genetic code , so we thought , &quot; We &apos;re building it in cassettes of the size of the virus , which means we &apos;re able to vary the size of the cassettes to understand what the individual components of a living cell are .
design is the key , and if you &apos;re using digital information in the computer , you have to really do this digital information to be flawless .
when we first saw the genome sequencing in 1995 , the error rate was one error per 10,000 base pairs .
we found 30 errors when resequencing , if we were using the original sequence , it would never have been possible to go up .
part of the design is to make pieces that are 50 letters long , and the design that are 50 letters long overlap pieces with other 50 letters to build smaller sub @-@ units to fit them together .
we have unique elements built in here .
you may have heard that we built watermarks .
think about it . we have a 4 @-@ letter code : a , C , G and T .
triplets of these letters , these letters encode about 20 amino acids , and here &apos;s a single determination for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to translate our words . sentences , thoughts .
at first we only signed .
some people were disappointed that there was no poetry .
we have the pieces constructed in such a way that we can simply break them down with enzymes , and there are enzymes that repair and reintegrate them .
and we started to create pieces , starting with pieces that were five to seven thousand letters , and they put them together to make 24,000 @-@ letter pieces , to reassemble them , up to 72 000 .
in every step , we have these pieces produced in surplus so that we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process , which they could do in a minute .
we tried to get to the point of automation .
so that looks like a basketball playoff .
if we are to get to these really big pieces , with over 100,000 base pairs , then they &apos;re not going to just grow in E.coli , it &apos;s going to exceed all the possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we turned to other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism that is called homologous recombination , which biology uses to make DNA , repair DNA that can fix these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of this : there &apos;s an organism called Deinococcus radiodurans that &apos;s three million wheel surviving radiation .
you can see in the upper field that his chromosome just falls apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything has changed so much as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be totally dried up , and they can even live in vacuum .
I am absolutely sure that space life exists and that it moves . I am looking for a aquatic environment .
in fact , NASA has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a picture of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by making this process use of , actually , we &apos;ve only got yeast mechanisms , using the right design design of the pieces , we &apos;ve adapted them . yeast then automatically adds them together .
that &apos;s not an electron microscope , it &apos;s a regular microscope image .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we even use it with the light microscope .
these are recordings for a duration of 6 seconds .
this is the publication that we have just completed recently .
these are over 580,000 letters of genetic code , it &apos;s the largest molecule with defined , defined structure that ever gets from humans to humans .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
if we are dealing with a font size of 10 and without spacing , it would be 142 pages , just to print this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s a virus that &apos;s very simple , it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier to do it in eukaryotes , as we are , and you take it , just take it out of the nucleus , and you give it in , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;re all hearing about cloning .
in archaebacteria , the chromosome is transferred to the cell , but recently , we &apos;ve shown that you can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another from one cell , and you can activate it .
we cleaned the chromosome of a microbial species . roughly speaking , these two are as far from each other as humans and mice . we gave some extra genes to choose this chromosome , and we could decompose it with enzymes to make all proteins destroy , and it was very amazing when we put it in a cell , and they &apos;re going to be our very mature graphics here .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to get the process a little further .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we find all kinds of species here that have a second chromosome taken up , or a third one from somewhere , every time thousands of characteristics in just one second , to add to a species .
so people who imagine evolution as a gene that &apos;s becoming a gene that &apos;s changed at a time have a lot of missed biology .
there are enzymes called restrictive enzymes that actually actually digest DNA .
the chromosome that is in the cell has none of the chromosomes that we inserted , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been doing .
it was found in the cell and it recognized the other chromosome as a foreign material , digested it , and so we had only one thing in the end , with a new chromosome .
it turned blue because of the genes we inserted .
and after a very short time , it had all the characteristics of the species lost and completely converted into a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve been able to put into the cell .
all proteins changed , the membranes changed as we saw the genetic code , and it was exactly that , what we transferred was .
it may be like genomic alchemy , but we can do it by moving the software DNA , changing things quite dramatically .
now I &apos;ve argued that this is not Genesis , it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion dollars a year of evolution .
and I &apos;ve argued that we might be doing this , a new form of Cambrian explosion , in which it &apos;s going to create massive new species formation based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we are in the process of getting six and a half to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context , I was born in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet are for everyone who lives in 1946 . within the space of 40 years , there will be four .
we have problems with food , fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6.5 billion people .
it will be a challenge to offer that for 9 .
we need more than five billion tons of coal , 30 @-@ plus billion barrels of oil , which is a hundred million barrels a day .
if we talk about biological processes or any process to do that , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
then of course , there &apos;s all the CO2 from this material that &apos;s landing in the atmosphere .
we have now come from our discoveries from all over the world to create a database of about 20 million genes , and I want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
the electronics industry had a dozen components , and look at the diversity that it created .
we are first and foremost encountering the borders of biological reality . we are also coming across those of our ideas .
we have technologies today because of these fast synthesis methods to do what we can do , what we call combinatorial genetics .
we now have the opportunity to create a big robot that can take millions of chromosomes a day , and we can do this .
if you imagine these 20 million different genes being produced , or these processes being optimized to be octane , or drugs being made , new vaccines , we can do with a small team of more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just male selection . we can select on viability , chemical production , or fuel production , vaccine production , and so on .
this is a recording of real design software , where we work , with which you actually sit down and new species on the computer design , you know .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like , we know exactly what their genetic code will look like .
we are now focusing on fuels from the fourth generation .
you recently have maize to ethanol , which is just a bad experiment .
we have used second and third generation fuels , which are coming out relatively soon , which will have much higher sugar @-@ making activities , like octane or different types of butanol .
but as we think , the only way that biology can have a big impact without further increasing costs on food or food , or limiting costs to availability , is to have a CO2 @-@ based base when we see CO2 , and so we &apos;re working on cells that go that way .
and we think we &apos;re going to start with the fourth generation of fuels , and we &apos;re going to be about 18 months .
sunlight and CO2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we &apos;ve all found different methods .
this is an organism that we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea about one and a half miles deep at almost boiling water temperatures .
it converts CO2 into methane , under the use of hydrogen as an energy source .
we investigate whether we use stored CO2 , which is easy to produce places , can convert that CO2 into fuel , to convert this process to drive it .
within a short period of time , we believe that we could be able to answer one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really have moderate targets , like replacing the entire petrochemical industry , exactly when you don &apos;t do this at TED , where else would be a major source of energy ?
but we &apos;re just as working on doing the same thing for developing vaccines .
you &apos;ve got it this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year back , right ? and you &apos;ve got a dollar too little if it comes to the right vaccine .
I think this will be changed by changing recombinant vaccines in the forefront , and I think that can be changed .
that &apos;s how the future might look like , with changes , today &apos;s evolutionary tree can be accelerated , with synthetic bacteria , archaea , and possibly eukaryotes .
we &apos;re light years away from improving people , and our goal is to just make a chance for us to have a long enough chance to survive , to do that . thank you .
what I &apos;m going to tell you first as quickly as possible is the basic work , a new technology that we call Microsoft part of a takeover , just a year ago , that &apos;s Seadragon , which is .
and it &apos;s an environment where you can either be local or away with huge amounts of visual data , and you can do it .
we see many , many gigabytes of digital photos here that you can seamlessly and continuously get up to , swivel in any way you can rearrange .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we look at , how big these collections are , or how big the images are .
most of them are digital photos of a camera , but this one is , for example , a scan from the Congress Library , and it &apos;s in an area of 300 megapixels .
it makes no difference , because the only thing that makes the performance of a system like this can limit is the number of pixels on your screen in .
every moment , it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of non @-@ image data .
that &apos;s Bleak House of Dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really a matter of a text , not a picture , it &apos;s possible to do something like that , to really do it , to show that this is a real representation of the text , not an image .
maybe this is an artificial way of writing an e @-@ book .
I wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a more realistic case , this is an issue of The Guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a section .
and that really gives you the pleasure and the good experience of being a real paper issue of a magazine or a newspaper , which in itself is a kind of medium with several orders of magnitude .
we also have something on the corner of this special edition of The Guardian .
we have a false message with very high resolution , which has been much higher than in a normal ad , and we have additional content , added .
if you want to see the features of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and this really does take up these ideas , these restrictions on the space available on the screen .
we hope that this will not be pop @-@ ups and other nonsense anymore , and that should not be necessary .
of course , mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and I really don &apos;t want to spend much time here , except saying that we &apos;re going to contribute to this area .
but these are all the streets in the U.S.A.
on top of the ground @-@ mounted image of NASA .
let us now have something else out of it .
that &apos;s even live on the Internet now . you can check it out .
this is a project called Photosynth , which really has two different technologies in common .
one is Seadragon and the other is a very good research . about ComputerVision , which is done by Noah Snavely , a university student at Washington University , under Steve Snavely &apos;s advice to UW .
and Rick Szeliski from Microsoft research was conducted a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the Internet , it &apos;s powered by Seadragon .
you can see that when we look at these kinds of views that we create , where we can penetrate through images , and this experience of multiple resolution .
but the spatial arrangement of the images is here in fact of significance .
computer vision algorithms have captured these images together to help them to get the real space in which these recordings , all of which are located near Grassi Lakes in Canadian Rockies , were matched to the real space in which they were made . you see elements of stabilized slides or panoramic image processing , and these things were all spatially related to each other .
I don &apos;t know if I still have time to give you other environments .
there are those who are much more spatial .
I would like to make a straight one of the original records of Noah , and that &apos;s from an early prototype of photosynth , where we first started working in the summer to give you this to show you what I think it really is the point behind this technology , the photosynth technology , and this is not necessarily the way it &apos;s obvious when you look at the environments that we &apos;re looking at the website .
we had to look at lawyers , etc .
this is a reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedral , which is built exclusively in computer .
with pictures of Flickr , you just give Notre Dame in Flickr a new and you &apos;ll get pictures of men in T @-@ shirts and on the university grounds , etc .
get each of these orange cone represents an image that is seen as belonging to this model .
so all of this is Flickr images , and they &apos;re all spatially on this way , in relation to each other .
and we can look at this very simple way .
you know , I never believed I would end up working at Microsoft .
I am very grateful for the welcome here .
I guess you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras , and everything is done from the mobile phone camera to professional SLRs , a pretty large number of them , all in this environment , that have been flicked together .
and if possible , I &apos;ll get some of the strange ones , many of them are covered with faces , etc .
somewhere here are a number of photographs , here they are .
this is actually a poster of Notre Dame , which was recorded correctly .
we can get from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we &apos;re doing things with the social environment , and now we &apos;re going to collect data from all of you .
from the entire collective memory , how visually Earth looks , and everything is going to be connected .
all these photos are connected to each other , and there &apos;s something bigger than the sum of the parts .
you will receive a model that will be created from all over the world .
look at this as the continuation of the work of Stephen Lawler on Virtual Earth .
and that &apos;s something that &apos;s caused by complexity that people use to do it , grows , and its benefits for the user with the application are growing ever larger .
your own photos are signposted with metadata that shows another person entering a picture .
if someone takes the trouble and has done all these sacred things , and tells who is going to be , then he will take my photo of the Notre Dame Cathedral suddenly with all these data , and I can &apos;t tell you how to start with it , and I can use it as a starting point to dive into this space , into this metaverse , to use the photos of other people , and thus create a kind of cross @-@ modal social experience with the use of other providers .
and of course by @-@ product , all of this is the immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the world that are not only superfluous or satellite images , and so on , but also collective memory .
thank you .
Chris Anderson : I understand you right . your software allows you to run within a certain time in the next few years all the images that someone in the world uses together in principle , in principle , to be linked together .
Baa : yes , it &apos;s just discovering when you want to , it creates hyperlinks between the images .
and she does this because of the content in the pictures .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you get to know the abundance of semantic information that many of these images have .
how if you want to search for images where you type sentences and the text of the website contains many information about how to create the image ?
but how about the picture ? you know , with all your pictures ?
then the scope of the semantic cross @-@ connection and the abundance that arises from it is really .
huge , it &apos;s a classic network effect .
ca : Blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations , Baa . have you . thank you .
do you know one of the big neglect when travelling and one of the joys of ethnographic research is , together with people , to live together who are still interested in the old days ? those who remember their past still have to live in the wind , they are on the rocks smoothed by rain , they touch them in the bitter leaves of the plants .
just knowing that Jaguar shamans are still beyond the Milky Way , or the importance of myths , the elders of Inuit , is still full of meaning , or that in the Himalayas , the Buddhists still breathe the breath of Dharma , means that the central revelation of anthropology into the memory of calling into mind : this is the thought that the world in which we live does not live in an absolute sense , but only exists as a model of reality
as a result of a group of certain possibilities of adaptation that our ancestors , although successful many generations ago , chose .
and of course , we all share the same adaptive needs .
we &apos;re all born , we &apos;re bringing kids into the world .
we go through initiation rituals .
we must deal with the unstoppable separation by death . we must therefore be able to do so , and it should not surprise us that we all sing , dance and produce art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique tone of the song , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter if it &apos;s a matter of the Penan in the forests of Borneo , or whether the voodoo acolytes in Haiti or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of northern Kenya , the Curanderos in the Andes , or a caravan factory in the middle of the Sahara - this is by chance the colleague I met a month ago in the desert , who I traveled to , or even a Yak shepherd on the slopes of Qom@@
Everest , the Mother of God of the World
all these people teach us that there are other ways of existence , other ways of thinking , other ways of orientating ourselves on Earth .
and that &apos;s an idea that , if you think about it , you can only fill it with hope .
together , the countless cultures of the world form a network of spiritual and cultural life that will encircle the earth and make it a good place for the Earth as important as the biological network of life that is known as the biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural network of life as an ethnosphere , and ethnosphere can be seen as the total sum of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations , and intuitions that have been influenced by human imagination since the beginning of consciousness .
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
it is the symbol of all that we are and what we call amazing , curious species , capable of .
and just like the biosphere was drained off a lot , this happened to the ethnosphere , only at even greater speed .
no biologist would dare to claim , for example , that 50 % or more of all species are just before extinction , because it &apos;s just not true , and yet this is the most apocalyptic scenario in the field of biodiversity , hardly anything that we see as the most optimistic scenario in the field of cultural diversity is known .
and the crucial indicator is extinction , the extinction of languages .
when each of them in this room was born , the first of them was 6000 languages on Earth .
now , a language is not just the whole of vocabulary , or a set of grammar rules .
one language is an expression of the human mind .
it is a means of bringing the soul of a particular culture into the material world , and it is a means of giving it access to the material world .
every language is like an old forest of spirit , a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and of these 6000 languages , today , while we &apos;re here in Monterey , half of them are no longer going to be in the ears of children .
they &apos;re no longer taught to infants , that is , if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be more lonely than enveloped by silence , one of the last of your people to be your language , who speak your language , not having the possibility of knowing the wisdom of ancestors , or of expecting hope to be children ?
and yet this terrible fate actually happens to someone somewhere on Earth , about two weeks every two weeks , because every two weeks an older person dies and takes the last syllables of an old language with him into the tomb .
and I know that some of you say , &quot; Is it not better ? &quot; so the world wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we all had one language to speak , and I say , &quot; Well , let this language be Yoruba . &quot; let it be cantonal .
let them be Kogi .
and then they would suddenly see how it would be if they had their own language not been able to speak .
so I want to put you on a journey through the ethnosphere today , a short journey through the ethnosphere , around to try to make you understand . what actually happens is what has been lost .
now there are some of us who are , in a sense , forgotten that when I say , different ways of being , really different ways of being , my own .
take for example this child , the Barasana , in the northwest of the Amazon , the Anaklona people , believe that they mythologically disbelieve the flow of milk from the east in the belly of holy snakes .
this is a people who don &apos;t cognitively distinguish between the colors blue and green , because the tent of heaven is different from the forest from the one people depend on .
you have a strange language and a marriage rule , called linguistic exogamy , you have to marry someone who has another language , and you have to marry .
all of this is rooted in the mythological past , the peculiarity of these great houses , where , due to mixed marriages , six or seven languages are spoken , is that you never hear someone who speaks a language .
you just listen and start to hear and talk .
or one of the most fascinating tribes I &apos;ve ever lived with , the Waorani , in the northeast of Ecuador , an amazing people that first came to contact peacefully in 1958 .
in 1957 , five missionaries tried to get in touch and made a serious mistake .
they threw shiny photos of themselves from the air , which we call friendly gesture . they were going to forget that they were people from the air forest in their homes in their lives never seen anything two @-@ dimensional .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , tried to get behind the face or figure , found nothing , and concluded that this was business cards of the devil and killed the five missionaries with the spear .
but the Waorani not only killed outsiders with the spear .
they pierced each other .
54 % of deaths were caused by drillings .
we followed geneaology for eight generations back and found two cases of a natural death , and when we saw people with emphasis doing something about it , they gave us that one of the people , so old , had become so old that he died because of his age , and we killed him anyway with the spear , but at the same time they had a clear knowledge of the forest that was amazing .
their hunters could not see the urine of an animal 40 steps away and determine which one species of animal belonged to .
in the early 1980s , I got a really amazing job when I was taught by my professor at Harvard if I could be interested in looking for Haiti . and I was told that secret societies were infiltrating the foundations of the strength of duvalier and duvalier and tonton macoutes , and that poison that was the poison that was used to get zombies to make sure .
to make sense of this sensation , I had to learn something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun , and Voodoo was a little bit of a cult of black magic .
on the contrary , it is a complex metaphysical world view .
it &apos;s interesting .
if I asked you , the big world religions , to list , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Buddhism , Judaism or whatever .
a continent is always left out , because the presumption was that it was not religious belief in black Africa . of course , there was one , and Voodoo is simply the remnant of these very profound religious thoughts that were found during the tragic diaspora of the slavery era .
but what Voodoo makes so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living bear the spirits .
the spirits can be heard from under the great water . answers to the rhythm of dance to the soul of the living temporarily pass away . thus , the acolyth is responsible for a short , shining moment to God .
Deshab : do the voodooists like to say , &quot; Your white ones go to church and talk about God . &quot;
we dance in the temple and become God .
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to be taken by the Spirit . how can you be hurt ?
see these amazing demonstrations of voodoo @-@ acolytes in a trance state , the glowing coal without burning , grabbing an amazing illustration of the ability of the mind to influence the body in such a way that it can endure it when it enters a state of extreme arousal .
now , of all the people I &apos;ve met , the Kogi were from Sierra Nevada , Santa Marta , in northern Colombia , the most extraordinary .
descendants of ancient tyrannical civilization that the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia populated and subsequently destroyed in the conquest , this ancient people settled in an isolated volcanic massif , which was spread over the Caribbean coastal plain .
in a bloodstained continent , these people were the only people who never had to be conquered by the Spaniards .
to this day , they are being treated by a ritual priesthood , training as a priesthood , but it &apos;s very extraordinary .
the young acolyths are born at the age of three and four by their families and are separated in a shadowy world of darkness in stone huts at the foot of the glaciers for 18 years . two periods of time of nine years , deliberately chosen , to the nine months of pregnancy , were chosen to imitate the nine months of pregnancy they spent in the womb of their mother , they now spend metamorphically in the womb of the great mother
and during all this time , they &apos;re going to culturally be incorporated into the values of their society , values that maintain the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic , or we could say , maintain the ecological balance .
at the end of this amazing initiation , you will suddenly be taken out one day and for the first time in your life , at the age of 18 , you will see a sunrise , and in this crystal clear moment of consciousness , the first light , when the sun begins to rise on the slopes of the amazingly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything you see in abstract learning , in amazing splendor , is confirmed and the priest resigns and resigns .
and says , &quot; Look , you know , it &apos;s really like I told you .
it &apos;s so wonderful , you have to protect it .
they call themselves the older brothers and say that we , who are the younger brothers , are for the destruction of the world responsible .
well , this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we think about natives and landscapes , we either invoke Rousseau and the old rumour of the noble wild , upward , which in its simplification is a racist thought , or on the other hand , Thoreau and say , &quot; These people are more connected to nature than we are . &quot;
so natives are neither sentimental nor will they be influenced by nostalgia .
it doesn &apos;t have much space to do in malaria @-@ contaminated swamps of Asmat or the cold winds of Tibet . however , they still have a lot of mystery through time and ritual formed a Earth &apos;s nimbus that doesn &apos;t have the idea of consciously approaching it , but rather on a far more subtle intuition of the idea that the Earth itself is only existing . because it exists in the human consciousness , it is inhaled .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little child from the Andes who lives in faith is growing up , that the mountain is an APU spirit that is his or her destiny , a whole different person will become and a different relationship with another person to this resource or place . it &apos;s a little child from Montana who lives in the faith that grows up in the belief that a mountain is a pile of stones that can be removed .
whether he is a place of residence , a spirit , or a pile of ore , is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that makes the relationship between the individual and nature defined .
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia and believed that these forests would be there . they were being rounded .
that made me another person than I was friends of the world of Kwakiutl who believe that these forests are the place of residence of Hukuk and the curved beak of heaven and cannibal spirits , who are at the northern end of the world , spirits that they are participating in their Hamatsa initiation .
now , when you start to look at the idea that these cultures create different realities , you can create some of their extraordinary discoveries , for example , this plant here .
it &apos;s a photo that I took last April in the northwest of the Amazon .
this is ayahuasca , of which many of you have heard , the strongest psychoactive drug from the repertoire of the shaman .
what makes Ayahuasca so fascinating is not only the pharmacological potential of this preparation , but also the processing of it . it &apos;s really made from two different sources : on the one hand , there &apos;s this wooden liane that has a number of beta @-@ carbolines , harmine , harmolin , slightly hallucinogen . taking this climbing plant alone is about as if a blue turmoil smoke is lying on its consciousness , but it &apos;s going to be taken with the
with the name Psychotria viridis mixed .
this plant contains some very strong tryptamins that are similar to serotonin , dimethyltryptamin @-@ 5 and methoxydimethyltryptamine .
if you have ever seen the Yanomami , how you can do this stuff , this substance that you can get from different kinds of stuff , also contains Methoxydimethyltryptamine .
this powder to snuff is about the same as a gun shot from a gun run , lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea . from electricity , it is not distorted the reality that is generated , but the dissolution of reality .
I even started with my professor Richard Evan Shultes , the man who was the psychedelic Area with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico in the 1930s , and I started to discuss it . I claimed that you could use these tryptamins not as hallucinogen , because in the 1930s , at the moment you saw the effects , you couldn &apos;t feel there anymore , you &apos;re there to experience hallucination , but the thing with
as they are characterized by a natural occurrence of an enzyme called monoamine oxidase in the human intestine .
you can only use some other devices in conjunction with oral treatment , which the Mao denaturate .
now , the fascinating thing is that the beta @-@ carbolins that are contained in the liane , the Mao inhibitors , are of exactly the kind that &apos;s necessary to potenate the tryptamins . so , ask yourself .
how can these people come from a flora of 80,000 species of astringent plants , these two morphologically unrelated plants , find the two that , if this combined , are a kind of biochemical version , so that the whole thing gets bigger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , trial and mistake , which is unimportant .
but if you ask the Indians , &quot; Say , &quot; The plant is talking to us .
so what does that mean ?
this tribe , the Cofan , has 17 variants of ayahuasca , which they all have at great distance in the forest , which are for our eyes to appear as a kind of .
and then you ask them how they can justify their taxonomy , and they say , &quot; I thought you understand something about plants .
I mean , you know , nothing at all , and I said , &quot; No .
so it turns out that you can see each of the 17 variants on full moon , and they sing to one in a different pitch .
now , that doesn &apos;t give you a PhD in Harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting to count than Stamina , now the problem is that even those of us who have sympathy for the difficult situation of the natives have the problem of being orginian and colorful , but they somehow look at the past as limited to the past , while the real world , that is , our world , is progressing .
so the fact is that you &apos;re going to look at the 20th century in 300 years , not for its wars or technical innovations , but rather as for an era in which we &apos;re here to be present , and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on Earth on either an active basis , or passively accepted , so the problem is not change , it &apos;s not .
all cultures have repeatedly taken part in dance with new possibilities for life .
and the problem is not technology at all .
the Sioux Indians stopped at Sioux no less than they bowed their bow and arrow tasks than the Americans stopped being Americans . Americans , when they were horse and horse @-@ drawn cars , were doing tasks .
not change and technology threaten the integrity of the ethnosphere , it &apos;s power to change the ugly face of domination .
and wherever you look at the world , you can see , you &apos;ll discover that these cultures don &apos;t go down . these are dynamic , living peoples whose existence is being made visible by recognizable forces that are being pushed out of their capacity to adapt , whether it &apos;s about the tremendous deforestation in the home country of the Penan , a nomadic people from Southeast Asia , Sarawak , a people who were free a generation ago in the forest .
and now to slavery and prostitution on the riverbank was humiliated from where you can see that even the river with the river mud is polluted . the almost half Borneo was buried in the South China Sea , which seems to float away from where the Japanese freighters can be seen on the horizon , ready to use their ship rooms with raw tree trunks that they could tear from the forest , or , in the case of the Yanomami .
where it &apos;s disease carriers who are dragged in during the gold rush .
or if we go up into the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m going to search a lot again , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the physical extinction of people , is generally condemned , but the ethnocide , the destruction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not condemned , but generally and widely celebrated as part of a development strategy .
and you can &apos;t see Tibet &apos;s suffering if you don &apos;t want to be experienced at the lowest level .
I traveled with a young colleague , 6000 miles from Chengdu , in western China , across the country , through southeast Tibet , to Lhasa , and only when I came to Lhasa , I saw the face behind the statistics , of which you hear 6000 holy monuments that turn into rubble and ashes , 1.2 million people who were killed during the Cultural Revolution by the cadres .
the father of this young man was born as a follower of the Panchen Lama .
that meant that he was killed during the Chinese invasion immediately .
his uncle fled with her holiness to the diaspora , people after Nepal brought .
his mother was imprisoned as punishment for the crime , affluent to be .
he was born at the age of two in prison to be smuggled under her skirt . because she was smuggled into prison without him , she could not live .
the sister who did this brave act was taken to an educational camp .
one day she accidentally stepped out of a bracelet , Maos , and for this transgression she had to go on for seven years to a heavy labour camp .
the suffering of Tibet can be unbearable , but the redeeming spirit of people is something unforgettable .
and in the end , we &apos;re really in front of an election , and if we want to be in a monochromatic world of monotony , or in a polychromatic world of diversity .
Margaret Mead , the great anthropologist , said before she died that it was her greatest fear that , while we were heading towards a thread of uncreative generic worldview , we were not only moving across the entire spectrum of human imagination to a narrowed way of thinking , but that we were going to be one day out of a dream , waking up and forgetting that it was ever other possibilities .
and it &apos;s humiliating to think that our genus might have been living for 600,000 years , maybe .
the Neolithic Revolution , which brought agriculture to us and brought us to the cult of the seed grain at this moment , the poetry of the shaman through the prose of the priesthood replaced and hierarchy , specialization and surplus created , found before only 10,000 years ago .
modern industrial world , as we know it , is barely 300 years old .
well , this superficial story doesn &apos;t tell me that we &apos;re all responding to the challenges we &apos;re facing in the next millennia , and we &apos;re going to have to face them .
if we look at these countless world cultures according to the meaning of humanity , they answer with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to rediscover the possibility of being what we are , people with full consciousness , who are aware of the importance of giving all people and gardens a space to flourish . and there &apos;s great things to do , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photo that I took at the northern end of the Baffin Islands when I was going to Narwhal hunting with Inuits , and this man , Olaya , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the Canadian government is not always very good at the inuit . and while the 1950s were not in the process of establishing our rule , the government was forced to move to settlements .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all weapons and all tools , and he was afraid of his life .
now you have to know that the Inuit is not afraid of the cold , they used it to their advantage .
the slide rails of their sled were originally made of fish wrapped in caricature skin .
the grandfather of the man was not afraid of the Arctic night or the blowing storm .
he slipped outside , let his pants out of seal fur down , and threw them in his hand , and when the feces began to freeze , he formed them into the shape of a knife .
he sprayed saliva on the sides of the sewage knife , and when it was completely frozen , he struck a dog with it .
he skinned the dog and improvised a tableware , took the skeleton of the dog , and improvised a sledge , stretched another dog , and vanished over the ice floes with the fecal knife on the belt .
so you can &apos;t do anything out of anything , and this is in many ways a symbol of resistance from the Inuit and all the natives on earth .
the Canadian government gave the Inuit in April 1999 the full control over a territory back to which it is larger than California and Texas , together .
it &apos;s our new home country , and it &apos;s called Nunavut .
it is an independent area . they control all mineral deposits .
an amazing example of how a nation , a state , can make reparations with its inhabitants and reach them .
and finally , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are going to be at these distant goals of the Earth , to realize that they &apos;re not at all distant .
they are the home countries of someone .
they represent parts of human imagination that have been going back to the past and that have become for all of us the dreams of these kids , like the dreams of our own children , part of the geography of hope .
what we did at National Geographic is try to believe that we politicians never have anything to achieve .
we believe that polemics , we believe that polemics is not convincing , but we believe that storytelling is changing the world and so we &apos;re not likely to be the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website receives 35 million hits every month , and we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world .
156 nations send our TV channel .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we &apos;re doing a number of trips to the ethnosphere where we &apos;re going to see our audience in places of such cultural wonders that they &apos;re going to be blinded by what we &apos;ve seen , and hopefully they &apos;re going to be one by one , and they &apos;re going to take the central revelation of anthropology , that this world has earned to exist in different ways , that we &apos;ve got a way of life in a truly multicultural , pluralistic world .
and when the wisdom of all men is to our common well @-@ being .
thank you .
I &apos;m going to give you some of the things that I &apos;m going to tell you about my book that cover you with other things that you &apos;ve heard about , and try to make connections if you don &apos;t notice them .
I would like to start with what I call official dogma .
the official dogma of what ?
the official belief of all Western industrial societies .
the official dogma is : if our goal is to maximize the welfare of our citizens , this is what is happening mainly through maximizing freedom .
the reason for this is that freedom is inherently good value for itself , useful and essential for humanity .
if people have freedom , everyone is acting independently , to protect things . they are maximizing our common good , and nobody has to be responsible for us .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choices .
the more choices people have , the more freedom , and the more freedom they have , the more common good they have .
this is what I think is so deeply rooted in us that there is no sense of being there , in questioning it .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
I &apos;ll give you some examples of what makes modern progress possible .
this is my supermarket , not a big one .
just a short while to salad dressings .
there are 175 dressings in my supermarket , if you want to buy the 10 different native olive oils and 12 balsamic vinegar varieties you could buy to make a large number of your own salad lingerie , in which unlikely you will not be one of the 175 in the store .
so this is how the supermarket works .
then go to an electronic store to create a stereo system , speakers , CD player , cassette recorder , radio amplifiers , and in this one electronics store there are so many stereo systems .
we can save 6.5 million different stereo systems , from the components that are used in this business .
you have to admit that this is a great selection .
in other areas , the world of communication .
there was a time when I was a boy , and there was every telephone service you wanted to do as long as he came from Ma Bell .
you rented the phone and you didn &apos;t buy it .
as a result , the phone was never broken .
these days are over .
we now have almost an infinite selection of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is the one in the middle MP3 player , nasal hair trimmer and crème @-@ brû<unk> flambierer .
and if you have not yet done so in your business , you should be sure that you have the opportunity to do so .
it makes people feel like they &apos;re going to go into business and ask this question .
do you know the answer to this question ?
the answer is no .
it is impossible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
for other areas of life that are much more important than shopping , the same goes for the explosion of choices .
health care in the United States is no longer the case that you have to go to the doctor and he says to you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says to you , &quot; We could do a or b . &quot;
a ) has these advantages and risks .
B ) has these advantages and risks ? what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; Doctor , what should I do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; A has these advantages and risks , and B has those benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; If you were me , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
and the doctor says , &quot; But I &apos;m not you .
the result is patient autonomy , which sounds like a good thing , but it shifts the burden of responsibility for the meeting of decisions taken by someone who wants to know something , namely from the doctor to someone who knows nothing and most likely is ill , and therefore not in the best condition to get the decision , namely the patient .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for prescription drugs for people like you and me , what if you think , no sense makes sense because we &apos;re not buying them .
why do you advertise us if we can &apos;t buy ?
because they expect us to be the closest doctor to call the next morning and to make a change to the prescription .
something as profound as our identity is now a question of choice , how this foil shows .
we don &apos;t inherit identity , we invent it .
and we invent ourselves so often as we like .
so every day , when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in relation to marriage and family , once the standard assumption of almost everyone was one , and one married as quickly as possible , and got children as quickly as one could .
the only real choice was who , not when , and not what they did afterwards .
today , everything is easy to have .
I teach wonderfully intelligent students , and I give them 20 % less work than before .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , or because they &apos;re less careful .
but because they &apos;re busy with other things , they &apos;re asking themselves , &quot; Should I marry or not ? &quot; now .
or later , I &apos;m supposed to have kids or make careers .
they are all engaging questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , even if they don &apos;t do their job and don &apos;t have a good grade in my course .
and you should do that in fact , these are important things to answer .
work , we are blessed , as Carl has pointed out , with the technology that allows us to get away every minute , every day from every place on the planet , to the Randolph Hotel .
there is also a corner from which I don &apos;t tell anybody , where the WLAN works .
I don &apos;t say anything because I want to use it .
this incredible freedom of choice in terms of work , making decisions , making decisions again and again , and again , whether we should work or not .
we can help our kids play football , watch with our mobile phone , on the one hip , and our BlackBerry , on the other hip , and on our laptop , probably on our lap .
and even if they &apos;re all off every minute in which we &apos;re giving our child mutilation of a football game , we &apos;re also asking ourselves , &quot; Should I take this call ? &quot;
the email answers the letter .
and even if the answer to the question is no , it will change your experience of football playing your child &apos;s game very differently than it would have been .
everywhere we look , big and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world in which we lived saw it look like this .
so I want to say that there were some choices , but not everything was a matter of choice .
and the world in which we now live sees it like this .
and the question is , are these good or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so I &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
all these choices have two effects : two negative effects on people .
one effect paradoxically is that he paralyses instead of liberating .
with so many options you can choose from , it &apos;s people who are very hard to get to grips with any decision .
I &apos;m going to give you another drastic example of this : a study on investment in voluntary retirement provision .
a colleague of mine had access to investment files from Vanguard , the giant fund company of about one million employees , and about 2000 different jobs .
and what she found was , per 10 investment funds offered by the employer , the participation was 2 percent lower .
they offer 50 investment funds , 10 percent fewer employees , participate than if they were just offering 5 percent . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 investment funds that are available to choose from , it &apos;s so hard to decide which to choose from , that they &apos;ll postpone it tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , never comes .
understand that this is not just what humans call dog food , if they eat in the retirement . because they &apos;re not enough money to get back , they &apos;re not enough money to go back . it also means making decisions , so hard is that they miss out on large investment opportunities from their employers .
the non @-@ participation gives you up to $ 5000 per year on from the employer to the happy one who would have been contributing to increase .
paralysis is a consequence of too many choices .
and I think it &apos;s a matter of making the world look like this : you really want to make the decision right when it &apos;s for all eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment fund , or even the wrong salad dressing .
so that &apos;s one effect , the other effect is that even if we &apos;re going to overcome paralysis and make a decision , we end up less satisfied with the result of choosing than when we &apos;re going to have had the opportunity to choose between fewer ways to do that .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is conditioned by the large selection of different salad dressings . if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect and which salad dressing is already perfect , it &apos;s easy to imagine that you &apos;re going to have a different decision that could have been better and what would have happened , this pictorial presentation of alternative leads to the fact that you regret the decision and regret it , has a negative effect on satisfaction that you have from your made decision .
even if it is a good decision .
the more opportunities there are , the easier it is to do nothing to regret , that is disappointing for the election you make .
second , what economists call oppertunity costs .
Dan Gilbert has a big point this morning , by telling us how much the way the species is in which we evaluate things depends on how much we do compare it .
well , if there are a lot of alternatives to consider , it &apos;s easy to imagine attractive properties , alternatives that exclude them , which makes them less satisfied with the alternatives that they choose .
here &apos;s an example of the things you don &apos;t know of as New York , and I apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple of the Hamptons .
very expensive properties .
wonderful beach , great day . you have it all for yourself .
what could be better , damn ?
the man thinks it &apos;s August , everyone in my neighborhood in Manhattan is gone .
I could go straight in front of my house .
and he spends 2 weeks thinking of being persecuted by him who has missed the opportunity to go day by day to a great parking lot .
oppertunity costs reduce the satisfaction we have achieved through our selection , even if what we choose is fantastic .
and the more opportunities to choose from , the more attractive properties of this selection are being developed in terms of oppertunity costs .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon makes some statements .
he makes a statement about it in living in the now , and maybe about slowly getting things done .
but an important point he makes is always who she &apos;s going to be for one thing to decide on . you &apos;re not going to do other things , and these other things like many attractive properties , and it &apos;s going to be what you &apos;re going to do , making less attractive .
thirdly , escalation of expectations .
this has hit me when I saw my jeans exchange .
I wear jeans almost all the time .
and there was a time when it was just jeans of a kind , and they have them bought them , and they have been poorly fit , they were incredibly uncomfortable , and if they had them worn long enough , and they had often washed enough , they started feeling OK .
so , to get new jeans , after many years of wearing the old and I went to buy jeans , and I said , &quot; I &apos;d like to have a couple of jeans . &quot; here &apos;s my size .
and the seller said , &quot; Do you want to have slender , slightly lying , or wide ? &quot;
do you want to use buttons or zipper stone or acid washed ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
do you want to cut down wide , tapered blah blah blah and so on ? he told .
my jaw was down , and after I recovered , I said , &quot; I &apos;d like to have the kind that used to be the only way .
he had no idea what that was , so I spent an hour trying to get all these damn jeans and dungeon the business and I went on to tell the truth with the best jeans , the best jeans I ever had .
I had better understand all this selection , and I was better able to have it .
but I felt worse .
why I wrote a whole book to try to tell myself it was a story ?
the reason I &apos;m getting worse was that I was having all these available options to meet my expectations for what kind of a good pair of jeans is going up .
I had very low expectations , I had no concrete expectations when it was only in a way that they were .
when they were in 100 species , one of them would have been perfect .
and what I got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so I compared what I had gotten to what I had expected and what I was expecting was disappointing in the comparison to what I had to expect .
adding options in the life of the people increases inevitably the number of expectations people have . people have a good idea of how good these opportunities will be .
and this leads to less satisfaction with the results , even if the results are good .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this .
because if you knew , you would not all know what it &apos;s all about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that everything was better before than anything worse was worse than everything worse . was it worse for the people to experience the experiences that people had a pleasant surprise ?
today , in the world where we live , we &apos;re wealthy industrialized citizens with perfection , expecting the best for the one you ever hope for , is that things are so good as you &apos;re doing from them .
they will never be pleasantly surprised because their expectations are high , my expectations .
the secret to happiness , that &apos;s what they all came for , the secret to happiness , are low expectations .
I would like to say a short autobiographical moment that I &apos;ve married to a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
I wouldn &apos;t have been able to do better . I didn &apos;t sit down .
but settling down is not always a bad thing .
ultimately , a consequence of buying a poorly seated jeans , if it &apos;s just a way to buy , is that if you &apos;re dissatisfied and you &apos;re wondering why you &apos;re responsible for who &apos;s the answer , it &apos;s clear .
the world is responsible , what would you have done ?
if hundreds of different types of jeans are available and you buy a one that &apos;s disappointing and you ask why you want to be responsible .
is it just as clear that the answer to the question is you ?
they would have been better off .
with 100 different types of jeans in the shop window , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so when people make decisions , and even when the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about that , they accuse themselves of doing so .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world , in the last generation .
I think a significant , not the only , but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression , and suicide , is that people have experienced those disappointing . because they have standards so high , they have standards so high , and then , if they explain these experiences to themselves , they think it &apos;s their fault .
and so the balance sheet result is that we generally do better to be objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official dogma that one of us all believes is right , completely wrong , and it &apos;s not true .
there is no question of choosing something better than not , but there is no question of it . more choice is better than selecting something .
there &apos;s a magical amount . I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
I &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;re going to have missed this point for a long time , when we &apos;re going to improve our common good .
now , as a principle , I &apos;m almost finished , as a principle , question , the thing to think about is what all of this selection allows , in industrialized societies , is the material , wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve seen a lot of them , whose problem is not the too large a selection .
your problem is that you have too little .
so things about which I &apos;m talking are a weird problem , the modern rich Western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and annoying is Steve Levitt has given them a story yesterday that these expensive and hard to fix child seats don &apos;t help .
this is a waste of money .
I &apos;m telling you that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not just that they &apos;re not helping .
they even hurt .
they ensure that we get worse , because we &apos;re getting worse .
if some of what people in our society can make choices in societies were postponed , in societies where people have too little choice , they don &apos;t only improve the lives of people , but also our dignity , and economists call this a pareto @-@ improvement application .
income redistribution will ensure that everyone is better off , not just the poor , because all these great choices are plaguing us .
finally , please read this cartoon and a sophisticated person , &quot; Ah , what does this fish know ? &quot;
you don &apos;t know anything possible in this goldfish glass .
impoverished fantasy , a short @-@ sighted view of the world , and that &apos;s the way I read it first .
the more I thought about it , the more I came to the view that the fish was a little bit white .
because the truth is that if you put the goldfish glass in place , everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom , you have paralysis .
if you break the goldfish glass so that everything is possible , lower the satisfaction .
they increase paralysis and lower satisfaction .
everyone needs a goldfish glass .
this is certainly too limited , perhaps also for the fish , but definitely for us .
but the absence of a metaphorical goldfish glass is a recipe for misery , and I suspect disaster .
thank you .
