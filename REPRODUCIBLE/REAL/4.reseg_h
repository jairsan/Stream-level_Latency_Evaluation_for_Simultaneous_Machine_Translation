last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ice cap that &apos;s close to three million years old , is the size of the lower 48 states , by 40 percent , shrunk . 
but this does not express enough . the seriousness of this particular problem , because it &apos;s not the thickness of the ice . in a sense , 
the arctic ice cap is the beating heart of our global climate system . 
it grows in winter and shrinks in summer . 
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a time lapse shot , which has happened over the last 25 years . 
the duration is marked with red . 
as you can see , it grows on the dark blue . this is the annual ice in winter . and it shrinks in summer , 
the so @-@ called &quot; dauereis &quot; , five years old or older , is almost like blood flowing out of the body here . 
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to have disappeared from here to here . 
this is a problem because warming causes the frozen reason to get the arctic ocean up , where it &apos;s producing large amounts of frozen carbon . which one , when he turns up from microbes to methane , 
compared to the total amount of climate @-@ changing substances in the atmosphere , could this amount double ? if we go beyond this critical point , 
today , in some shallow lakes in alaska , methane is already bubbling out of the water by itself . 
professor katey walter of the university of alaska is working with another working group on another flat one . lake traveled last winter ( 
video ) wow . al gore : you &apos;re doing well . the question is , how will we be ? 
and one reason is this enormous heat storage system is warming greenland from the north . 
this is an annual dew water flow . 
but the volumes are much larger than ever before . 
this is the kangerlussuaq river in southwest greenland . 
if you want to know how sea level rises through land ice melting , here it flows into the sea . 
these rivers are growing rapidly , and 
at the other end of the planet . the antarctic , the largest ice mass on the planet 
last month , researchers reported that the entire continent is now having a negative ice balance . 
and the west antarctica , which has emerged over a few underwater islands , is particularly strong in melting . 
this corresponds to 20 feet above sea level . 
just as greenland is the third largest ice mass in the himalayas , you see new lakes up there , which were glaciers a few years ago . 
40 percent of all people in the world get half of their drinking water . from this melting water 
in the andes , this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city . 
the quantities of water have increased . 
but if they seal , most drinking water will also fall away . 
in california , a 40 percent reduction in the snow cover of the sierra was seen . 
this concerns the storage tanks 
and the predictions you read them , are serious . 
this drying up all over the world leads to a dramatic increase in fires 
and disasters everywhere in the world have caused . in a really extraordinary and unprecedented extent , 
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 . 
this is a completely untenable pattern of development . 
if you want to look at this in the historical context , you can see what it &apos;s doing . 
in the last 5 years , we &apos;ve been producing 70 million tons of co2 . every 24 hours , 25 million tons a day in the oceans . 
look at the eastern pacific area , exactly from the american continent to the west and on both sides of the indian subcontinent , where there is a drastic decline in oxygen . in the oceans , 
the biggest single factor for global warming is deforestation , which is 20 percent , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s like . burning fossil fuels ( 
oil ) is a problem . and coal is the biggest problem . 
the united states is one of the two largest polluters , along with china . 
and the proposal was to build many more coal factories . 
but we &apos;re starting to see a change . 
here are the ones that have been deleted in recent years . with some green alternatives proposed , 
but there is a political struggle in our country 
and there is a coal industry and oil industries that have a quarter of a billion dollars spent last year in order to apply clean coal , which in itself is a contradiction . 
this picture reminded me of something 
around christmas . i ran around home in tennessee , a billion tons of coal sludge . 
they probably have it in the news . 
this is happening throughout our country , america &apos;s second largest waste flow . 
this happened around christmas , 
one of the commercials of the coal industry . at christmas , this frosty was 
the carbarian , a happy , happy guy . 
he &apos;s in abundance and in america . and it helps our economy to grow . 
frosty : the carboniferous man gets cleaner every day . 
it &apos;s affordable and adorable , and workers stay in wages and bread . 
al gore : this is the source of most coal in west virginia . 
the most powerful miner is the leader of massey . coal 
video don blankenship let me make one thing quite clear . al gore , nancy pelosi , harry reid you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about . 
al gore : so the alliance for climate protection has launched two campaigns . 
this is part of her 
video actor . at coalergy , we see climate change as a serious threat to our business . 
so we &apos;ve got it to be the top line . spending a considerable amount of money to launch an advertising campaign to boost the truth about coal . 
the fact is , coal is not dirty . 
we believe it &apos;s clean and smells good . 
so don &apos;t worry about climate change . 
leave that quiet to us . ( 
video , actor ) saueber kohle you &apos;ve heard a lot about it . 
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean coal factory . 
fantastic . this machine is pretty noisy . 
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology . 
and yet the burning of coal . one of the main reasons for global warming is the remarkably clean coal technology that you see here changes . 
all of this . look at it . this is today &apos;s clean coal technology . 
al gore : finally , the positive alternative is mixed with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security . 
video narrator : america is in crisis . the economy , national security , the climate crisis , 
the red thread that connects all of these is . our dependence on carbon @-@ based fuels , such as dirty coal and foreign oil . 
but now there &apos;s a brave new solution to get us out of this miserable situation . 
supply america with 100 percent clean electricity . within the next 10 years , 
a plan to bring america back to work , make us safer and help us to make global warming stop . 
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems . 
supply america new ! find out more ! 
al gore : this is the last video . 
narrator : it &apos;s about resupplying america , 
one of the fastest ways to reduce our dependence on old dirty fuels that suffocate our world . 
man : the future is here , wind , sun and a new energy system . 
man no. 2 : new investments to create well @-@ paid jobs 
narrator : supply america new it &apos;s time to accept reality . 
al gore : there &apos;s an old african proverb : &quot; if you want to be fast . &quot; go alone when 
you want to get far , go together . 
we must go far , fast . 
thank you . on the 
last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc . 
and i promised to come back to explain to them how the machine works . 
so now it &apos;s time for everyone to come , and for those who were not there at that time . the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever to be tackled . 27 kilometers in diameter . 
his task is to create the conditions that are less than a billionth of a second after the universe began . and that &apos;s up to 600 million times within a second . 
it &apos;s just breathtaking , ambitious . 
this is the machine . below geneva : 
we take pictures of these mini big bang in detectors , 
and i &apos;m working on this . he &apos;s called atlas . detector : 44 meters in width 22 meters in diameter here &apos;s a 
spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction , so you can see the size . 
on september 10 last year , the machine was running for the first time . 
and this image was taken by atlas . 
it caused immense cheering in the control room . 
it &apos;s a picture of the first particle of radiation that &apos;s going back the entire route around the lhc , then deliberately collided with part of the lhc to get a rain of particles on the detector . 
in other words , when we took this picture on september 10 , we knew that the machine was working , which is a great triumph . 
i don &apos;t know if this produced the greatest cheer , or if this was someone who visited the google page . and the home page , so it found 
, means that we have a cultural influence next to the scientific one 
week later . was there a problem with the machine that was connected to these wires here ? these golden wires , 
these wires , these wires , are 13 thousand amps . if the machine is running at high performance , 
now the engineers , among them , will look at you and say , &quot; no . &quot; they don &apos;t do that . these are small wires . you 
can do that . because if you cool them very far , they become superconductors in minus 271 degrees . 
so colder than the space between the stars , these wires can withstand the tension . 
in one of the connections between over nine thousand magnets in the lhc , there was a manual defect . 
so the wires are heated slightly , and 13 thousand amps met . suddenly , electrical resistance . 
this was the result . 
now , all of this is even more impressive . if you imagine that the magnets are over 20 tons , and they &apos;re about 30 cm shifted . 
so we damaged about 50 percent of the magnets and 
we had to remove them . what we did , 
we conditioned . they repaired them . 
they are all back on their way . 
towards the end of march , the lhc will be operational again . 
we will turn it on and expect first data in june or july to be collected , and we will continue our journey to find out what the building blocks of the universe are . 
now , of course , in a way , these accidents are rekindling . the debate on the value of science and engineering at such borders . it &apos;s easy to reject this . 
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to understand the fact that we &apos;re beyond our borders is the value of things . like the lhc , 
i will give my final words to an english scientist , humphrey davy , who , as i suspect , when he was defending his apprentice &apos;s useless experiments , was michael faraday . the following said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous . for the development of the human mind to assume that our scientific ideas are final , that there are no mysteries in nature , that our triumphs are full and that our triumphs are not new worlds . 
thank you . 
i want to start by asking you to go back to the time you were a child . thinking back when they played with blocks of 
building , while they realized how to stretch out and grab hands , pick up and move the blocks , they actually learned to think about and change problems by understanding and changing spatial relationships . 
spatial thinking is closely connected to how we can make up a lot of our environment . 
as an informatics scientist , inspired by the way we interact with real objects together . with my expert advisor patti and my colleague jeevan kalanithi , i began to wonder . what if we were to use computers that were used instead of a mouse @-@ pointer that was like a digital finger tip on a flat worksurface ? what if we were to intervene with both hands and physically take data and 
take it so that it could be ordered as we want it to be ? 
this question was so gripping that we were looking at the answer . and siftables developed , 
in short , a siftable is an interactive computer in the size of a biscuit . 
you can move by hand . they can perceive each other . you can capture your movements . and they have a screen and a radio receiver . 
much more important are physical . why you just use them like blocks of blocks by stretching your hands and accessing them can move . 
and the siftables are an example of a new generation of tools to manipulate digital data . 
and if these aids become physical and a consciousness of their movements , each other will recognize each other . and the subtleties of our dealings with them perceive . then we can start exploring new and entertaining interaction types . 
i &apos;m going to start with some simple examples . 
this siftable is configured for video playback . and if i put it in one direction , the video is played forward . if i put it in the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards . 
and these interactive portraits are mutually perceptible . 
so if i put them side by side , you &apos;re arousing interest . 
if you are surrounded by one @-@ wire , you notice that too , and you can get a little nervous . 
and they feel their movements and inclinations . 
an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to recognize was that we had to look at everyday gestures on data , like colors , to pour them as much as we did with liquids . 
in this case , we have three siftables configured as color pots . and i can use them to paint in the middle , to pour paint in the middle , where they &apos;re mixed . 
if we exaggerate it , we can pour it back a little . 
there are also some nice ways to get into education , such as languages , mathematics , or logic games , where we can give people the chance to try out quickly . and the results want to see immediately . 
here i am . this is a fibonacci episode that i &apos;ve created with a simple equation program . 
this is a game with words that are a kind of mixture of scrabble and boggle . 
basically , you get every round on each siftable random assigned letter . and while you &apos;re trying to make words , they &apos;re checked by a dictionary . 
then after about 30 seconds , it &apos;s mixed again . and you have a new combination of letters and new ways to try out . 
thank you . 
these are some children who are on a trip to the media lab . i could get them to try it out , and i recorded a video of it . 
you really loved it . 
an interesting fact about this type of application is that you can &apos;t get people to give you many instructions . 
all you have to say is , &quot; make words . &quot; and you know exactly what to do . 
here are a few people who are testing it . 
this is our youngest . beta testers down there right . 
it turned out that he was only stacking the siftables . 
so for him , they were just building blocks . 
this is an interactive animation . 
we wanted to develop a learning tool for learners . 
that &apos;s felix . 
he can put new characters into the scene by playing the siftable from the table , which takes this figure . 
here he lets the sun rise . 
now he &apos;s picking up a tractor in the scene . 
good work . yes , 
by shaking the siftables . and she puts it side by side , he can let the characters interact . 
inventing his own history it 
&apos;s a story with an open end . and he can decide how it develops . 
the last example i have time for today is to show it , a music sequencer for live performances that we &apos;ve recently developed . and in the siftables , as sounds like leadership voice , bass and percussion , they act . 
each has four different variations . you can choose which one you want to use . 
and you can put these sounds into the sequence that you can put into any pattern , and you can feed 
them in by going into the sequence of just a sound @-@ siftable , holding them to a sequence @-@ siftable . 
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filter . 
you connect it to a certain tone and then tend to adjust it . 
and then more generally , effects like tempo and volume that you can see on the whole sequence . 
so let &apos;s look . 
we start in which we have the lead voice fed into two sequence siftable . and these in a series , they sort of sort of add up , and add a little bit more of the voice . 
now i add a bass . 
now i &apos;m going to do some more stuff about it . 
and now i connect the filter with the drums so that i can control the effect live . 
i can speed up the whole sequence by moving the pace into one or the other direction . 
and now i connect the filter to the bass for a little more expression . 
i can see the sequence as it runs out . 
so i don &apos;t have to plan them in advance , but can improvise , prolong or shorten them . 
and finally , i can hide the whole sequence by reading the volume @-@ siftable to the left . 
thank you . 
so , as you can see , my enthusiasm is to develop new human computer interfaces that are better suited to how our brains and bodies work . 
and today i had time to give you a part of this new design world . and some of the ways we can show what we &apos;re working on in our lab . 
the idea i &apos;ve been putting you on the road is that we &apos;re going to be on the threshold of this new generation of witnesses , to interact with digital media . the information in our world brings our requirements . 
thank you . 
i look forward to meeting you all . 
i am a writer . 
writing books is my profession . but it &apos;s more than that , of course . 
it &apos;s also my great lifelong love and fascination . 
and i don &apos;t expect that to change . 
but recently , something strange in my life and career has happened that has led me to think about my relationship to this work completely , 
and i think it &apos;s a very strange thing . this strange event was that i recently wrote a book . a biography called eat pray love this decided differently from all my previous books for some reason in the world and a new big mega event . international bestseller thing became . 
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m coming from . 
as if i were doomed to 
fall , seriously doomed to destruction . for example , they &apos;re very worried about me and they say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that they &apos;ll never exceed that success ? &quot; don 
&apos;t be afraid that you can spend your whole life writing down and never create a book again . someone in the world never cares again . okay 
. this really makes you brave . 
but it would be worse . if i don &apos;t remember that i was over 20 years ago when i was a teenager , when i first came to tell me that i was going to be a writer , with the same kind of fear @-@ filled reaction , i was confronted . 
people said , &quot; don &apos;t you be afraid ? &quot; never succeed . are you not 
afraid that humiliation of a rejection will kill you ? 
are you not afraid that you can make your life go on for this craft and never come up with anything from it , and that you die on a scrap pile of burst dreams ? your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failure . so 
, you know , you know . 
the answer : the short answer to all these questions are indeed . 
yes . i &apos;m afraid of all these things . 
and i always had that . 
and i have a lot more fear of things that nobody would ever suspect of , like algae and other terrifying things . 
but when it comes to writing , i think about it recently , and i wonder . why is that ? 
it 
is logical that someone expects to be expected to be afraid of it . it is logical that someone should be afraid of doing the work he feels called to do . 
and what exactly is the creative ? companies based in the netherlands lot that you &apos;re unsure about the state of mind . in a way that other professions don &apos;t do . 
my father , for example , was a chemist . and i can &apos;t remember any situation in his 40 years as a chemist , in which he was asked if he was afraid of becoming chemists , and i can &apos;t remember 
that . with your chemist blockade , john , how are you doing it ? 
it just didn &apos;t happen . but do you know 
to be fair ? the group of chemists have not been able to gain the reputation of alcoholic , manic @-@ depressive over the centuries . 
we get people , writers seem . but this kind of reputation , but not just writers , but writers , all genres of creativity , seem to have this reputation . mind , being incredibly unstable . 
all you need to do is to get rid of the bitter death figures of really great minds from the 20th century alone . the young and often died by their own hands . 
and even those who did not actually begin suicide seemed to be really neglected by their talents . 
norman mailer said shortly before his death in his last interview : each of my books has killed me a little further . 
an extraordinary statement that you make about your life &apos;s work . 
but we &apos;re not even twitching when we say something like this , because we &apos;re hearing this kind of statement for so long . somehow we have internalized the view and collectively accepted that creativity and suffering somehow naturally belong together . and that art always ends up in torment . 
the question i have to ask everyone here today is this idea for you , completely in order . 
feel at ease with it , 
because with just one centimeter distance , you look at it . i feel very happy with this view . 
i find them horrible . 
and i think it &apos;s dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch them take over to the next century . 
i think it &apos;s better . if we encourage our great creative people to live , 
and i definitely know that for me , in my situation , it would be very dangerous . to begin this dark path of presumption , so to speak , to leak down , especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career right 
now . that means : see . i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old . 
i may have another 40 years of work in me . 
and it &apos;s very likely that all i &apos;ve been writing from now on will be from the world as the work is being assessed that &apos;s going on after the success of my last book . right ? 
i say it straight away . because we &apos;re here . yes . now , everybody , kind of friends . it is highly likely that my greatest success is behind me . 
oh jesus ! what a thought ! 
these are the kinds of thoughts that make someone think about it at 9 a.m. gin gin to drink . and i don &apos;t want that . 
i would rather continue to do this work that i love . 
so the question is how to 
get to grips with some time of reflection , and i think i &apos;m going to write about it , a sort of protective psychological construct . somehow i 
have to go from now on . writing a safe distance to keep between me and my very natural anxiety about how the world &apos;s response to the written being will be . 
while i was looking for models for this last year to do that , i also have a lot of searching for in the past . and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they might have better or more sensible ideas about it . when we , like you , can help creatives deal with the emotional risks associated with creativity . 
this search led me to ancient greece . and ancient rome . 
please follow me . because the circle will close again . 
but in ancient greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity was coming from people . okay . they 
believed creativity was a kind of divine servant spirit that came from a distant , unknown source to people , from inexplicable , unknown reasons . 
the greeks called these divine servants @-@ spirits of creativity demons of socrates is 
known to believe in it . he would have a demon who would have told him wisdom from afar . 
the romans had the same idea , they called it . this kind of body @-@ less , creative spirit , a genius . 
that &apos;s great . the romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius , a particularly smart individual . 
they believed that a genius could use this kind of magical divine being . believed that it was literally written in the walls of an artist &apos;s studio . about the same as dobby , the housekeeper , who would come out and be assisting the artist in the work , in a way , invisible . and the result of the work would be to design . 
that &apos;s brilliant . there &apos;s it . there &apos;s the distance i talked about . the psychological construct that you have to understand from the consequences of your work . 
and everyone knew it worked like this . right ? 
the artist of antiquity was above all protected , such as the way too much narcissism is right . 
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at everything for you . book now . everyone knew you could have this body @-@ less genius that helped you . 
when your work flopped , not entirely your mistake , or 
everyone knew your genius was a bit lame . 
so people in the west have really been thinking about creativity for a long time . 
and then the renaissance came . and everything changed . we had this big idea . and this big idea was , let &apos;s put the human individual at the center of the universe , about all gods and mysteries . and there &apos;s no room for mystical creatures anymore . the commands of the divine accept . 
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism . and people started to believe that creativity was completely different from their own individual . 
for the first time in history , people hear this or that artist . a genius , instead of being a genius . 
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake . 
you know , i think allowing a mere person to think he &apos;s going to be like that vessel , like that basin , like the essence , and the source , of all the divine , creative , unknown , infinite . mystery is a little bit too much responsibility to give it to a fragile human psyche . 
it &apos;s like asking someone to see the sun swallow . 
this distorts and distorts whole ego &apos;s . and it creates all these unattainable expectations of success . 
i think that this pressure to succeed , our artists , has destroyed the last 500 years . 
and if that &apos;s true . and i think it &apos;s true , is the question . 
can we change it ? 
maybe to an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of creative return . 
maybe not . 
maybe we can get the idea out of 500 years of rational humanism not just in an 18 @-@ minute talk . 
and there are certainly people in this audience who really have legitimate scientific doubts about the way they think about basically fairies , people follow , and fairy @-@ birds on their projects , etc . 
i &apos;m probably not going to put all of you on this journey . 
but the question i want to raise is , why ? not . 
why not think about it ? 
because it makes just as much sense as anything else i hear from . when it comes to making absolutely crazy the capricious creativeness of the creative process . 
a process that , as everyone knows , is ever trying to do something . so in other words , everyone here , not always sensible . 
in fact , sometimes he can be almost paranormal . 
i recently had such an encounter . when i was born to meet ruth stone , an extraordinary american poet who is now over 90 , but who was a poet all her life . she told me that when she was in virginia , she grew up in the village , she was working outside in the fields . she said she would feel and hear how a poem about the landscape on . it would come to pass . 
she said it was like a thundering train out of air that 
was going to roll over the country to her . 
she felt when it came , because it would make the earth under her feet quake . 
she knew she was in such a moment doing only one thing . and that was in their words , &quot; race like the devil . &quot; 
she ran like the devil to the house while she was persecuted by this poem . it was only about them being quick enough to make a sheet of paper and a pen so that they could get it through them , if it thunder through them , catch it and hold it on the sheet . 
and in other paintings , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran . but she didn &apos;t reach the house . and the poem rolled through them . and she missed it . she said it would continue to move over land . and as she said , looking for another poet . 
and then there were these moments , and i &apos;ll never forget that part . she said there were moments when she was almost missing it . 
so she runs to the house and looks for the paper . and the poem goes through them . and she takes a pen . just when it goes through it . and then she said , &quot; it was like you were going to grab her other hand and grab it . 
get it back . the poem on his tail and pulled it back into her body and took it over to the sheet of paper . 
on these occasions , the poem came flawlessly and intact on paper . but backwards from the last word . for the first time 
, when i heard that , i thought , &quot; this is scary . that &apos;s just like my creative process . 
that &apos;s not like my creative process at all . i &apos;m not the channel . 
i &apos;m a mule to be able to work , i have to work every day at the same time , and sweat , i have to work hard and really torment unpleasant . 
but even i , in my mule species , sometimes striped this thing . 
and i guess many of you also did that . 
even i had work or ideas that came from a source through me that i really didn &apos;t identify . 
what is that ? 
and how do we relate to it without having to lose our mind , but rather , on the contrary ? even in mental health . 
for me , the best thing is : living example of how to do this . the musician tom waits i was allowed to thank him for a magazine a few years ago . 
we talked about this topic . and you know what ? most of his life was tom , the embodiment of the tormented modern artist who tried to ... these uncontrollable creative impulses that lived in him to master and to cope with them . 
but then he got older and quieter . he told me that one day he was on a highway in los angeles . and then everything changed for him . 
he went at high speed when he suddenly saw a small fragment . a melody that sounds like inspirations , often for him tormenting , it is hard to grasp . and he wants them . it &apos;s magnificent . he then leaks . but he can &apos;t hold it . 
he has no piece of paper . he has no pen . he has no cassette recorder . 
so he starts this old anxiety in him , like , &quot; i &apos;m going to get up . this thing will lose and be played forever by this song . 
i &apos;m not good enough . i &apos;m not going to do it . but 
instead of panic , he just stopped . 
he finished the whole thought and did something completely new . 
he just looked into the sky and said , &quot; excuse me , can &apos;t you see i &apos;m driving a car ? &quot; 
i look like this . as if i were writing a song . 
if you really want to exist , come back to a more favorable moment . if i care about you 
, if not torment , today someone 
else goes and torment leonard cohen 
, all the work process has changed . 
not the work itself . it was still often as dark as ever . 
but the process and the heavy grief that surrounds him was lifted . when he got the genius out of himself , where he had nothing but trouble , and left him back where he came from , so to speak . he realized that there &apos;s no internally tormenting thing to be . 
it could be a strange , miraculous , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the stranger . external thing that &apos;s not . tom was 
very much in the process of hearing this story , and it changed a little bit . the way i worked , and it has already saved me . 
this idea saved me . when i was in the middle of the writing process of eat pray love , i fell into one of these ducts of doubt that we all fall into . if we work on something and it doesn &apos;t work , you catch thinking that it &apos;s a disaster . that &apos;s the worst book ever written . 
not only bad , but the worst of all times . 
i started thinking . i just should stamp the project . 
but then i remembered how tom was in the open sky talking about . and i tried it . 
so i lifted my gaze from the manuscript and i said my comment towards an empty corner of space . 
i said loud , &quot; hear , you thing , you and i know both of them . if this book is not brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my fault . right ? 
because you see that i &apos;m all i &apos;ve invested . i have no more than that . so 
if you want to have it better , you have to cross up here and keep your share of the deal . okay . 
but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what the hell is doing with it . 
i will continue to write . because this is my job . 
and i would like to make a record of the fact that , for my part , i was here today for the job . 
because in the end , it &apos;s as follows : centuries ago , in the deserts of north africa , people turned to moonlight festivals with sacred dances and music . the hours were held until dawn . 
these festivals were always great , because the dancers were professional . and they were fantastic . 
but now and then , very rarely , something special happened . one of the actors was actually superworldly . 
and i know you know what i mean . because i know that they all live in their lives before , and i &apos;ve seen such a performance . 
it was as if the time was standing still and the dancer was stepping through a kind of gate . he did nothing but he ever did it before . 1,000 nights ago but everything went together . 
and suddenly he didn &apos;t appear pure , human anymore . 
he was illuminated from within and illuminated from below . and everything was illuminated by a divine fire as such . 
at that time , people knew what that was . they called it by its name . 
they put their hands together and started singing . allah allah allah god god god - that is god . 
you know , 
interesting historical footnote when the ethiopian southern spain . they conquered , brought this custom with them , the debate changed . over the centuries , from allah allah to allah , to olé olé olé , which is still being fought by bullfights and flamenco dances . 
if a actor in spain is doing something impossible , something magical . allah olé olé allah great bravo incredible . there &apos;s it . a fleeting look at god 
and that &apos;s great . because we need that . 
but the tricky part follows the next morning . if the dancer wakes up and realizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday , and he &apos;s no longer a little bit of god in himself . 
he &apos;s just an aging mortal with painful knees . and maybe he will never again go up to these heights . 
and maybe someone will never call god &apos;s name again . when it turns , but what should it do with the rest of its life ? 
that &apos;s hard . 
this is one of the most painful corrections to a creative life . 
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of pain . if you don &apos;t believe from the beginning that the most extraordinary aspects of your life would come from you . 
if you might just believe that you are a loan from an unimaginable source for a fine time of your life , which is connected to someone else . when you &apos;re done with it 
, when we start thinking about it , change . all 
this . so i started thinking . and so i think i &apos;m sure . in recent months , while i was working on the book that will soon appear as the dangerous , scary , strongly awaited . successor of my successful race , 
which i have to say myself constantly . if i get crazy about it , i &apos;ve got don &apos;t be afraid , 
don &apos;t be discouraged . just do your job is 
still there for your contribution . whatever he is . 
may your job be dancing . 
if the stupid divine genius that leads you to the side decides for a short moment a touch of wonder through your effort to show . then olé 
and if not , dance your dance and olé 
for you . despite all this , i 
believe . and i feel we should teach that olé for you . 
despite all this , simply for you to be able to understand the mere human love and attachment to it . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
june cohen olé 
you know , i &apos;ve already talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome . and what that might mean , and about discovering new groups of genes . in fact , 
we &apos;re starting from a new point . we &apos;ve digitized biology . and now we &apos;re trying to move from digital code to a new phase of biology . by creating new life and building new life . 
we have always tried to ask important questions . 
what is life ? it &apos;s something that &apos;s happening . i think that many biologists have tried to understand this and to do it at different levels . 
we have tried different approaches to make it possible to use it to simplify the minimum components . 
we have digitized for nearly 20 years . when we sequenced the human genome , the change from analogue to analogue world of biology to digital world was happening . the computer , 
now we &apos;re trying to ask if we can regenerate life , or if we can create new life . this digital universe . 
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma geitalium , which is the smallest genome of a species that has replicated itself in the lab . and we tried to see if we could do this with an even smaller genome . 
we managed to do it . at about one hundred genes to refrain from the 500 or so . these are : but 
if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to our confidence , you know , me . that &apos;s simple . but if we all look at these genes that we have one after the other , we can eliminate , it &apos;s very unlikely that this will lead to a living cell . 
so we decided that it was the only way forward . this chromosome actually synthesize what allows us to synthesize the individual components and thus to change some of these fundamental questions . 
and so we started to ask , &quot; can we synthesize a chromosome ? 
&quot; and it allows chemistry to actually make these really big molecules , which has never been done before . 
and if we can , we can start the chromosome . 
a chromosome is just one piece of inert chemical material by 
the way . our steps in digitizing life were exponential , 
our ability to use genetic code has changed dramatically . but , in fact , it has increased . and our last point would now be an exponential curve . 
we started 15 years ago . 
it actually took a few years , starting with a bioethical review . before we did the first experiments , 
it turned out , dna synthesization is very difficult . 
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that are making small pieces of dna . 30 to 50 letters long but it &apos;s a degenerative process . so the longer you do a piece , the more mistakes happen . 
so we had to develop a new method that we could use to compose these little pieces and correct the mistakes . 
that was our first attempt , starting with the digital information of the genome phi . x 174 
it &apos;s a small virus . the bacteria kill . 
we made small pieces , made a bug correction , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters . 
the exciting phase came when we inert this piece of chemical and put it into a bacterium , and the bacterium started to use genetic code to read and make viral particles . 
the viral particles were then released by the cells and came back and killed e. coli . 
recently , i spoke to the oil industry . and they said they were understanding this model exactly . 
they laughed more than you do here . so we think that &apos;s a situation . in the software , actually , building your own hardware can be in a biological system . 
but we wanted to go a lot further . we wanted to build a whole bacterial chromosome . it has more than 580,000 letters of genetic code . so we thought . we build it in cassettes . from the size of the virus , which means the size . the cassettes could vary to understand what the individual components of a living cell are . 
design is the key . and if you &apos;re using digital information in the computer , this digital information really needs to be flawless . 
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the error rate was one error per 10,000 base pairs . 
we found 30 errors in resequencing . if we use the original sequence , it would never have been possible . going up , 
part of the design is to create pieces . the 50 letters are long and those with other 50 letters have to overlap pieces to create smaller sub @-@ units so that they fit together . 
we have built unique elements here . 
you may have heard that we have built watermarks . 
think about it . we have a 4 @-@ letter code a , c , g and t 
triplets . this letter , these letters , encode about 20 amino acids . and here &apos;s a single provision . for each of these amino acids , 
we can use the genetic code to write our words . sentences &amp; thoughts at 
first we only signed . 
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry . 
we have constructed the pieces in such a way that we can simply break them down with enzymes . there are enzymes that repair and reintegrate them . 
and we started to create pieces , starting with pieces that were five to seven thousand letters . this one to make 24,000 @-@ spelling pieces together , to reintegrate them , up to 72,000 . 
in every step , we &apos;ve got these pieces in surplus so that we could sequence them . because we tried to make a very robust process , which you could see in a minute . 
we have tried to get to the point of automation . 
so that looks like a basketball playoff . 
if we go to these really big pieces , with over 100,000 base pairs . then they &apos;re not just going to grow in e.coli . it exceeds all the possibilities of modern molecular biology . and so we turned to other mechanisms . 
we knew of a mechanism called homologous recombination , which biology is using to make dna , to repair dna that can bring together these pieces . 
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s an organism called deinococcus radiodurans that &apos;s three million wheel surviving radiation . 
you can see in the upper field that his chromosome just falls apart . 
12 to 24 hours later , everything has been assembled together again as it was . 
we have thousands of organisms that can do that . 
these organisms can be totally dried up . you can even live in vacuum . 
i am absolutely sure that space life exists and moves . looking for aquatic conditions ? actually , nasa has shown that 
it has a lot of it out there . 
here &apos;s a picture of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using these processes , and we &apos;ve got a picture of it . in fact , we &apos;ve only used yeast mechanisms with the right design . we have adapted the pieces to them . yeast automatically adds them together . 
this is not an electron microscope . it &apos;s a regular microscope image . 
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even do it with the light microscope . 
these are recordings of a duration of 6 seconds . 
this is the publication that we &apos;ve just finished recently . 
these are over 580,000 letters of genetic code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with a defined structure that ever created by humans . it has a molecular 
weight of over 300 million . 
if we &apos;re dealing with a font size of 10 , and without spacing , it would be . it has 142 pages . only to print this genetic code . 
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ? 
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria . 
it &apos;s also easier . if you look at it in eukaryonts like us , you just take the nucleus out and give it another one in . and that &apos;s exactly what they all know about cloning . 
in archaebacteria , the chromosome is integrated into the cell . but just recently , we &apos;ve shown that you can see a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another . and we can activate these , 
we cleaned . the chromosome of a microbial species , roughly speaking , are these two , as far from each other as humans and mice . we gave some extra genes to this so that we could choose this chromosome . we decomposed it with enzymes to treat all proteins . and it was very amazing when we put it in a cell . and they &apos;re going to be our very mature graphics . here , 
the new chromosome went into the cell . 
in fact , we thought that &apos;s the end here . but we tried to get the process a little further . 
this is the main mechanism . evolution here . 
we find all kinds of species . here &apos;s the second chromosome that we &apos;ve taken , or a third one from somewhere . every time thousands of characteristics are to be transformed into a species in just one second . 
so , the evolution that evolution imagines as a gene that &apos;s changed at a time , have a lot of missed biology . 
there are enzymes called restrictive enzymes that actually digest dna . 
the chromosome that was in the cell has none of the chromosomes that we inserted . already . 
it was expressed in the cell and recognized the other chromosome as alien material . digested it . and so we had only one cell in the end with a new chromosome . 
it turned blue because of the genes that we had inserted . 
and after a very short time , it had all lost the characteristics of the species and completely converted it into a new species . based on the new software that we put into the cell . 
all proteins changed , the membranes changed when we saw the genetic code . was it exactly what we transferred ? it 
may sound like genomic alchemy . but we can do this by moving the software dna , and we can change things quite dramatically . 
now i &apos;ve argued that this is not genesis . this is based on 3.5 billion years . evolution 
and i &apos;ve argued that we might be doing this , a new form of cambrian explosion , where it &apos;s going to create massive new species formation based on this digital design . 
why should we do that ? 
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious . with regard to what we need . 
we are in the process of getting six and a half to nine billion people . in the next 40 years , 
to grow it in my context . i was born in 1946 . 
today , three people on this planet are for everyone who was born in 1946 . within 40 years , it will be four . 
we have problems with food , fresh and clean water . medicine - fuel for 6 5 billion people . 
it will be a challenge to offer that for 9 . 
we need more than five billion tons of coal . 30 @-@ plus billion barrels of oil these are a hundred million . barrels a day if 
we think about biological processes or any process to replace that , it will be a huge challenge . 
then of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material that lands in the atmosphere . 
we have now come from our discoveries all over the world to create a database of about 20 million genes . and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future . 
the electronics industry had a dozen components . and look at the diversity . and this is what 
we &apos;re going to see here , first and foremost , as we &apos;re going to see the limits of biological reality . and to those of our ideas , 
we have technologies today . because of these fast synthesis methods to do what we call combinatorial genetics . 
we now have the opportunity to create a big robot that can take millions of chromosomes a day . 
if you imagine these 20 million different genes being produced , or these processes being optimized to make octane , or drugs , new vaccines . we can only work with a small team to change molecular biology . when the last 20 years of science , 
and it &apos;s just male selection . we can select for viability , production of chemicals or fuel production , vaccine production , and so on . 
this is a recording of real design software that we work with , which actually sit down and create new species on the computer . 
you know , you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like . we know exactly how their genetic code will look . 
we are now focusing on fourth generation fuels . 
they recently used corn to see ethanol . what just ? a bad experiment is , 
we have fuels . the second and third generation , which will soon come out , will have much higher sugar @-@ making activities , like octane or different kinds of butanol . 
but as we think , the only way that biology can have a big impact without further increasing food costs or increasing food costs , or limiting their availability , is if we &apos;re going to see co2 as the raw material . and so we &apos;re working on cells that go that way . 
and we think we &apos;re going to start with the fourth generation of fuels . and that &apos;s about 18 months of 
sunlight and co2 , and that &apos;s a method . 
but in our discovery of the world , we &apos;ve all kinds of different methods . 
this is an organism that we described in 1996 . 
he lives in the deep sea , about one and a half miles deep , at almost boiling water temperatures . 
it converts co2 into methane , using the hydrogen as an energy source . 
we investigate whether we can use stored co2 , which is simply being brought to production sites . convert co2 to fuel to drive this process . 
within a short period of time , we believe . we could be able to . one of the fundamental questions of life to solve 
. you know , we really have moderate targets , like replacing the entire petrochemical industry . and that &apos;s exactly when you couldn &apos;t do that at ted , where else to become a major source of energy . 
but we &apos;re just working on it right now . the same approaches to the development of vaccines . 
you have this year with flu , you &apos;ve seen it . we are always one year behind and have a dollar too little if it comes to the right vaccine , and we have a dollar too little . 
i think that can be changed by recombinant vaccines being used in advance . 
that &apos;s how the future might look . with changes , the evolutionary tree can be accelerated today , with synthetic bacteria , archaea , and possibly eukaryotes . 
we are light years away from improving people . our goal is to only have a chance to have a long enough survival to possibly end that . thank you . 
what i want to tell you first as quickly as possible is the basic work , a new technology that we call microsoft part of a takeover , just a year ago , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been passing . 
that &apos;s seadragon . and it &apos;s an environment where you can either be local or away with huge amounts of visual data , and you can do it . 
we see many , many gigabytes of digital photos here that you can seamlessly and continuously get up and running , swivel in any way you can rearrange . 
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we look at , how big these collections are , or how big the images are . 
most of them are digital photos of a camera . but this one is , for example , a scan from the congress library . and it &apos;s in an area of 300 megapixels . 
it makes no difference . because the only thing that can be done to limit the performance of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen . at every moment . 
it also has a very flexible architecture . 
this is a whole book . an example of non @-@ image data . 
this is bleak house of dickens . each column is a chapter 
to prove that it really is a matter of a text , not a picture , and it &apos;s a text . can we do something like that to really show that this is a real representation of the text , not an image ? 
maybe this is an artificial way to read an e @-@ book . 
i would not recommend it . 
this is a more realistic case . this is an edition of the guardian . 
every big picture is the beginning of a section . 
and that really gives you the pleasure . and the good experience . a real paper edition of a magazine or newspaper to read what is itself a kind of medium with several orders of magnitude . 
we also have something on the corner of this special edition of the guardian . 
we have a false message with very high resolution , which is much higher than a normal ad , and we have a very high resolution . and we added additional content . 
if you want to see the features of this car , you can see them here , 
or other models . or even technical specifications . 
and this really takes up these ideas , these restrictions on the space available on the screen . 
we hope that this will not be pop @-@ ups and other nonsense anymore . this should not be necessary . 
of course , mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this . 
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here . except to say that we are also contributing to this area . 
but these are all streets in the u.s.a. 
, all of them in the upper picture 
of the nasa . let &apos;s do something else now . 
that &apos;s even live on the internet . you can check it out . 
this is a project called photosynth , which really has two different technologies that connect . 
one is seadragon and the other is a very good research on computer vision , which is done by noah snavely , a university student at washington university , under the advice of steve seitz at uw . and rick szeliski , who 
was conducted by microsoft research , was a very good collaboration . 
so this is live on the internet . it is powered by seadragon . 
you can see that . if we take these kinds of views that we create , where we can penetrate through images . and this experience of multiple resolution makes . 
but the spatial arrangement of the pictures is here . in fact , of importance , 
the computer vision algorithms have captured these images together so that they can give the real space in which these recordings , all near grassi lakes in the canadian rockies , made in the canadian rockies . you see elements of stabilized slides or panoramic image processing here . and these things were all related spatially to each other . 
i don &apos;t know if i still have time to give you other environments . 
there are those that are much more spatial . 
i would like to make a straight one of the original records of noah . and that &apos;s from an early prototype of photosynth , where we first saw the summer work to give you that to show you what i think i think it &apos;s really the point behind this technology , photosynth technology . and this is not necessarily so obvious . if you look at the environments that we have on the website , 
we had to look after lawyers , etc . 
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral . notre dame , who is only in computer with pictures of flickr . 
just give notre dame in flickr . and they &apos;re going to take pictures of men in t @-@ shirts and on the university grounds , etc . 
each of these orange cones represents an image that is part of this model . 
so all of this is flickr images . and they all stand up spatially , in this way , in relation to each other . and 
we can look at this very simple way . 
you know , i never believed that i would eventually work with microsoft . 
i am very grateful for the welcome here . 
i guess you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras . everything is connected from the mobile phone camera to professional . slrs : a pretty big one . number of them all in this environment have been patched together . and 
if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the strange . many of them are covered with faces , etc . , 
somewhere . here are a number of photographs . here are you : 
this is actually a poster of notre dame . the record was recorded correctly . 
we can get from the poster to a physical view of this environment . 
the point here is that we &apos;re doing things with the social environment . 
now , data is collected from all , from all the collective memory , from how visually earth looks . and everything is connected . all these photos are connected 
to each other . and there &apos;s something happening . that &apos;s bigger than the sum of the parts . 
you get a model that &apos;s coming from all over the world . 
consider this as the continuation of the work of stephen lawler on virtual earth . 
and that &apos;s something that &apos;s caused by the complexity that people use it , grows , and its benefits for the user with the application . 
your own photos are getting bigger and bigger . with metadata signposted to another person who entered . 
if someone makes the effort and all of these saints have labeled themselves and tells who they all are . then my photo of notre dame cathedral suddenly gets taken with all these data . and i can use it as a starting point to dive into this room , into this metaverse , to take photos of other people , and so i can use a kind of cross @-@ modal social experience with the use of other providers . 
and of course by @-@ product , all of this is the immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the world that can be seen not only by overflights or satellite images and so on , but by collective memory . 
thank you . 
chris anderson : i understand you . right ? your software allows you to run within the next few years at a certain time all images that someone in the world uses together . in principle , 
they are linked together . yes . it does nothing but discover . if you want , it creates hyperlinks between the images . 
and she does this because of the content in the pictures . 
and that &apos;s really exciting . if you want to remember the abundance of semantic information that many of these images have . 
how to search a web for images where you enter sentences and the text of the website contains many information about how to create a picture ? but how about the picture , if you 
were to link it to all of your pictures ? then 
the scope of semantic cross @-@ connection and the abundance that arises from it is really enormous . 
it &apos;s a classic network effect . 
ca blaise that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations . baa have 
you got it ? thank you . you know , one of the big neglect when you travel . and one of the joys in ethnographic research is , together with people , to live in the same way that they remember the old days , which have still been past in the wind , to feel it on the rocks smoothed by the rain . touch in the bitter leaves . the plants taste simple . 
the knowledge that jaguar shamans are still travelling beyond the milky way , or the meaning of the myths of the elders of inuit is still of great importance , or that the buddhists in the himalayas still breathe the dharma . does the central revelation of anthropology mean to recall ? that &apos;s the idea that the world in which we live , not in an absolute sense , exists , but only as a model of reality . 
as a result of a group of certain possibilities of adaptation that our ancestors , although successful many generations ago , chose . 
and of course , we all share the same adaptive needs . 
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing kids to the world . 
we go through initiation rituals . 
we must deal with the unstoppable separation of death . and so it should not surprise us that we all sing , dance . and bring forth art . 
but the unique tone of the song is interesting : the rhythm of dance . in every culture , 
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the penan in the woods , in borneo , or whether it &apos;s the penan . or the voodoo acolyths in haiti . or the warriors in the kaisut desert of northern kenya . the curanderos in the andes or a caravan factory in the middle of the sahara . this is by chance the colleague i was talking to a month ago in the desert , or even a yak shepherd who was on the slopes of qomolangma everest 
, the godmother of the world . 
all these people teach us that there are other ways of existence , other ways of thinking , other ways of orientating ourselves on earth . 
and that &apos;s an idea that , if you think about it , you can only fill it with hope . 
together , the countless cultures of the world form a network of spiritual and cultural life that encloses the earth . and for the welfare of the earth , as important is the biological network of life that you know as a biosphere . 
you can imagine this cultural network of life as an ethnosphere . ethnosphere can be considered the total sum of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations and intuitions that come from human imagination . since the beginning of consciousness were created , are defined . 
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity . 
it &apos;s the symbol of all that we &apos;re . and what we know as amazing , eager species . 
and just like the biosphere was drained off a lot , this happened to the ethnosphere , just at even greater speed . 
no biologist would dare to claim , for example , that 50 % or more of all species are just before extinction , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet this is the most apocalyptic scenario in the field of biodiversity , which is hardly in line with what we see as the most optimistic scenario in the field of cultural diversity . 
and the key indicator is the extinction of languages . and 
when each of you was born in this room , on earth , 6000 languages were spoken . 
now , language is not just the whole of vocabulary , or a set of grammar rules . 
a language is an expression of the human mind . 
it is a means of bringing the soul of a particular culture to the material world . 
every language is like an old forest of spirit . a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities . 
and of these 6000 languages , today , while we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , exactly half of them are no longer in the ears of children . 
they &apos;re no longer taught to infants . that means that if nothing is done , they are actually dead . 
what could be more lonely than to be enveloped by silence ? one of the last of your people to speak your language . no way to have it . the wisdom of the ancestors to pass on or the hope of expecting children . 
and yet this terrible fate actually happens to someone somewhere on earth . ca : all two weeks , because every two weeks , an older person dies and takes the last syllables of an old language with him into the grave . 
and i know that some of you say , &quot; is it not better ? &quot; so the world would not be a better place . if we all speak only one language , and i say , &quot; well , let this language be yoruba . &quot; let them be cantonese . 
let them be kogi . 
and then they would suddenly realize . how it would be if you didn &apos;t speak your own language ? 
so i want to put you on a journey through the ethnosphere today . a short journey through the ethnosphere to try to understand them . what actually lost was actually lost . 
now there are some of us who are , in a sense , forgotten that when i say , different ways of being , really different ways of being . 
i &apos;m taking this kid , barasana , for example , in the northwest of the amazon , the anaklona people , believe that they mythologically believe that they &apos;re going to see the flow of milk from the east in the belly of holy snakes . 
this is a people who don &apos;t cognitively distinguish between the colors blue and green . since the tent of heaven is to the forest , from which men depend . 
they have a strange language . and a marriage rule called linguistic exogamy . you have to marry someone who speaks another language . 
all of this is rooted in the mythological past , the peculiarity of these great houses , where six or seven or seven languages are spoken because of mixed marriages , is that you never hear someone who learns a language . 
they just listen and start to talk . 
or one of the most fascinating tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the waorani , in the northeast of ecuador . an amazing people who first peacefully lived in 1958 . 
in 1957 , five missionaries tried to get in touch and made a serious mistake . 
they threw shiny photos of themselves from the air . what we value as a kind gesture , and you forgot that these people were coming from the rainforest in their lives never before seen anything two @-@ dimensional . 
they took these photographs from the forest floor , tried to get behind the face or figure , found nothing , and concluded that this was business cards of the devil , and killed the five missionaries with the spear . 
but the waorani not only killed outsiders with the spear . 
they pierced each other . 
54 % of deaths happened through holes . 
we followed geneaology eight generations back and found two cases of a natural death . and when we emphatically put people in question , they gave them the idea that one of the people had become so old that he had become so old that he died because of his age . and we killed him anyway with the spear . but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest . the amazing thing was , 
their hunters could get the urine of an animal from 40 steps away and determine which species it belonged to 
in the early 80s , and i got a really amazing job when i was . my professor at harvard asked if i was interested in going to haiti and trying to get secret societies infiltrated that would make the foundation of strength of duvalier . and tonton macoutes were . and the poison that was used to kill zombies . 
to make sure that this sensation makes sense , i had to know something about this remarkable faith of vodoun . and voodoo is not a cult of black . magic - 
on the contrary . it is a complex metaphysical view of the world . 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if i asked her , to list the great world religions . what would you say ? 
christianity in the united states islam buddhism judaism or whatever . 
a continent is always omitted . because the presumption was that there was no religious belief in black africa . of course , there was one , and voodoo is simple . the remnant of these very profound religious thoughts that were found during the tragic diaspora of the slavery era . 
but what makes voodoo so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead . 
the living bear the spirits . 
the spirits can be seen from under the great water . answers to the rhythm of dance to the soul of the living temporarily suppress . so that the acolyth is for a short , shining moment to god . 
deshab : do the voodooists like to say ? you white people go to church and talk about god . 
we dance in the temple and become god . 
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re taken by the spirit . how can you be hurt ? 
see these amazing demonstrations of voodoo @-@ acolytes in a trance state , touching the glowing coal without burning . an amazing illustration of the capacity of the mind to influence the body in such a way that it can endure it when it enters a state of extreme arousal . 
now , of all the people i &apos;ve met , the kogi from sierra nevada , santa marta , in northern colombia , were the most extraordinary 
descendants of ancient tyrannical civilization that has reached the caribbean coastal plain of colombia . and as a result of the conquest , this people moved into an isolated volcanic massif . the sea rising above the caribbean coast . 
in a bloodstained continent , these people were . the only ones that never were conquered by the spaniards 
to this day , they are being treated by a ritual priesthood , training as a priesthood , but it &apos;s very extraordinary . 
the young acolyths are born at the age of three and four by their families . and in a shadowy world of darkness , in stone huts , at the foot of the glaciers , for 18 years , shut down . two periods of nine years , deliberately chosen to spend the nine months of pregnancy that they had in their womb , their mother &apos;s womb . now , spend metamorphically in the womb of the great mother . 
and during all this time , they &apos;re culturally incorporated into the values of their society . values that maintain the claim that their prayers and prayers , and only their prayers , the cosmic , or we could say , maintain the ecological balance . 
at the end of this amazing initiation , you &apos;ll one day . suddenly taken out . and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 . see a sunrise . and in this crystal clear moment of consciousness , the first light , when the sun begins to climb onto the slopes of the amazingly beautiful landscape . suddenly , everything you learned in abstract is going to be all you did . in astonishing splendour , confirmed and the priest resigns 
and says , &quot; look , you see , it &apos;s really like i told you . 
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . 
they call themselves the older brothers and they say that we , the younger brothers , are for the destruction of the world responsible . 
well , this level of intuition is very important . 
whenever we think about natives and landscapes , we either invoke rousseau and the old rumour of noble wild heralds , which are in its simplification . a racist thought is , or on the other hand , thoreau , saying , &quot; these people are more connected to nature . so when we &apos;re natives 
, we &apos;re neither sentimental . they are still weakened by nostalgia . 
there is not much room for it . in the malaria @-@ contaminated swamps of asmat or the cold winds of tibet . but they have , however , a mysterious nimbus through time and ritual that has not been formed on earth , which is not based on the idea of being consciously close to it , but on a far more subtle intuition of the idea that the earth itself can exist only because it breathes into the human consciousness . 
now , what does that mean ? 
it means that a little child from the andes who believes in the belief that the mountain is an apu spirit , who is his or her destiny to determine , is a completely different person . and another relationship to this resource or place has nothing but a small child from montana , who lives in faith in the belief that a mountain is a pile of stones . the wearer can be removed 
whether he is a abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant . 
the interesting thing is the metaphor that makes the relationship between the individual and nature defined . 
i grew up in the forests of british columbia and believed that these forests were there to be rounded . 
that made me another person . when my friends among the kwakiutl who believe that these forests are the whereabouts of hukuk and the curved beak of heaven and the cannibal spirits , who are at the northern end of the world , spirits who they participate in their hamatsa initiation . 
now , when you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can see some of their extraordinary discoveries . for example , this plant here . 
it &apos;s a photo that i took last april in the northwest of the amazon . 
this is ayahuasca , of which many of you have heard , the strongest psychoactive preparation from the shaman &apos;s repertoire . 
what makes ayahuasca so fascinating is not only the pharmacological potential . this preparation , but its processing . it &apos;s really going to be made from two different sources . on the one hand , there &apos;s this wooden liane that has a number of beta @-@ carbolines ( harmine , harmolin , hallucinogen ) . this climbing plant alone is about as if a blue turmoil is smoke on it &apos;s consciousness . it is however covered with the leaves of a shrub from the family of coffee plants 
called . psychotria viridis mixed 
this plant contains some very strong tryptamins that are similar to serotonin , dimethyltryptamin @-@ 5 and methoxydimethyltryptamine . 
if you have ever seen the yanomami as you can snuff this stuff . this substance that you produce from different kinds also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine , 
this powder to snuff is about the same as from a gun run to be shot . lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity . there will be no distortion of reality , but the dissolution of reality . 
i even met my professor richard . evan shultes the man who has the psychedelic erea with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico . in the 1930s , it has begun to discuss this . i claimed that you didn &apos;t see these tryptamins as hallucinogen . since at the moment when the impact is felt , you no longer have to be there to avoid hallucination . but the thing about tryptamins is that they &apos;re not taken orally . 
because they &apos;re taken by a human gut @-@ like thing . of course , occurring enzyme named monoamine oxidase will be denaturated . 
you can only use it in conjunction with some other chemicals orally that the mao denaturate . 
now , the fascinating thing is that the beta @-@ carbolins that are contained in the liane , the mao inhibitors , are of exactly the kind that &apos;s necessary to potenate the tryptamins . so ask yourself . 
how can these people come from a flora of 80,000 species of astringent plants ? these two morphologically unrelated plants find that , if this is combined , a kind of biochemical version creates a kind of biochemical version , so that the whole thing is larger than the sum of its parts . 
we use this great euphemism , trial and mistake , which turns out to be meaningless . 
but if you ask the indians , say , &quot; the plant speaks to us . so 
what does this tribe mean ? 
the cofan have 17 variants of ayahuasca , which they all have at great distance in the forest , which are known to our eyes as a kind of appearance . 
and then you ask them how they explain their taxonomy . and they say , &quot; i thought you understand something about plants . 
i mean , you know , nothing at all . and i said , &quot; no . so 
it turns out that you can see each of the 17 variants on full moon , and they sing to one in different pitches . 
now , this doesn &apos;t give you a phd in harvard . but it &apos;s much more interesting to count than stamina . well , the problem is that even those of us who have sympathy for the difficult situation of the natives , they call them &quot; orginous and colorful . &quot; but somehow they &apos;re confining themselves to the past , while the real world , our world , is progressing . 
so the fact is that you &apos;re going to look at the 20th century in 300 years , not for its wars or technical innovations , but rather for an era in which we &apos;re here , and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity and the massive destruction of the earth . either actively supported or passively accepted . so the problem is not change . 
all cultures have repeatedly taken part in dance with new possibilities of life . 
and the problem is not technology itself . 
the sioux indians stopped listening to sioux as they bowed and bowed and arrow tasks as the americans . stop being americans when they used horse and horse @-@ drawn cars 
, tasks don &apos;t threaten change and technology . the integrity of the ethnosphere it &apos;s power . the ugly face of the rule and 
wherever you look at the world , you will discover that these cultures are not dedicated to destruction . these are dynamic peoples whose existence is characterized by recognizable forces that are beyond their capacity to adapt . whether it &apos;s the tremendous deforestation in the home country of penan , a nomadic people from southeast asia , sarawak , a people who had been free to live in the forest a generation ago , 
and now become slavery and prostitution . the river bank was humiliated from where you can see that even the river with the mud is polluted , which is almost half borneo into the south china sea . it seems to float from where japanese freighters can be seen on the horizon . they are ready to use their ships to fill their ships with raw tree trunks that they have taken from the forest . or , as in the case of the yanomami , 
where there are pathogens that were introduced during the gold rush . 
or if we go into the mountains of tibet , where i &apos;m looking for a lot of stuff . if you look at the ugly face of political dominance , 
you know , the genocide , the physical extinction of people , is generally condemned . but the ethnocide , the destruction of the way of life . people will not only not be condemned , but generally and widely regarded as part of a development strategy . 
and you can &apos;t understand tibet &apos;s suffering . if you don &apos;t experience it at the lowest level , 
i went to a young colleague , 6000 miles from chengdu in western china , across the country , through southeast tibet , to lhasa . and only when i came to lhasa did i see the face behind the statistics , which you hear 6000 holy monuments , which are in debris and ashes , turned . 1.2 million people who were killed by the cadres during the cultural revolution . the father of 
this young man was called the follower of the panchen lama . 
that meant that he was immediately arrested during the chinese invasion . 
his uncle fled with her holiness to the diaspora . people in nepal brought 
his mother was imprisoned as a punishment for the crime of being wealthy . 
he was born at the age of two and smuggled into prison to get under her skirt . since they do not live without him . 
the sister who did this brave act was taken to an educational camp . 
one day , she accidentally kicked off a bracelet , maos . and for this violation , she had to go into a heavy labour camp for seven years . 
the suffering of tibet can be unbearable . but the redeeming spirit of men is something unforgettable . 
and in the end , we &apos;re really in front of an election . do we want to be in a monochromatic world of monotony or in a polychromatic world of diversity ? 
margaret mead , the great anthropologist , said before she died that it &apos;s her greatest fear . that while we are heading towards a thread of uncreative generic world view , we are not only moving the entire spectrum of human imagination to a narrowed way of thinking , but also seeing that one day we are awakening from a dream and forgetting that it has ever been possible for others . 
and it &apos;s humiliating to think that our genus , maybe for 600,000 years , exists . 
the neolithic revolution , which brought agriculture to us and brought us to worship the seed grain at this moment . the poetry of the shaman through the prose of the priesthood replaced and hierarchy created specialization and surplus , found before only 10,000 years ago . 
the modern industrial world , as we know it , is barely 300 years old . 
well , this superficial story doesn &apos;t tell me that we &apos;re all responding to the challenges that we &apos;re facing in the next millennia . 
if we look at these countless world cultures , after the meaning of being human , they answer with 10,000 different voices . 
and in this song , we &apos;re going to rediscover the possibility of being what we are , people with full consciousness , who are aware of the importance of giving all people and gardens a space to flourish . it is necessary to ensure that : and there are great moments of optimism . 
here &apos;s a photo that i took at the northern end of the baffin islands . when i was hunting with inuits , and this man told olaya to tell me a wonderful story of his grandfather . 
the canadian government is not always very good at inuit . and during the 1950s , when the establishment of our rule was established , they were forced to move to settlements . the grandfather of 
this old man refused to family . 
the fear of his life had taken him all weapons and all tools . 
now you have to know that the inuit is not afraid of the cold . they used them to their advantage . 
the slide rails of their sled were originally made of fish wrapped in caricature skin . 
the man &apos;s grandfather was not afraid of the arctic night or the blowing storm . 
he slipped outside , let his pants down from sea fur , and threw them in his hand . and when the feces started to freeze , he formed them into the shape of a knife . 
he sprayed saliva on the sides of the sewage knife . and when it was completely frozen , he struck a dog to skimmed 
the dog and improvised a tableware , took it . the skeleton of the dog and improvised a sledge , clung another dog , and vanished over the ice floes with the fecal knife on the belt . 
so you can do something out of nothing . and this is a symbol of many ways of resistance from the inuit and all natives on the planet . 
the canadian government gave the inuit in april 1999 full control of a territory . that &apos;s bigger than california and texas together . 
it &apos;s our new home country . and it &apos;s called nunavut . 
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all mineral deposits . 
an amazing example of how a nation , a state , can seek reparation with its inhabitants 
and reach them . and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious . at least for those of us who are heading towards these distant goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not at all distant . 
they are the home countries of someone . 
they represent parts of human imagination that have come back to the past and are being used for all of us to make the dreams of these children like the dreams of our own children , part of the geography of hope . 
what we finally try to do at national geographic is we believe that politicians never achieve anything . 
we believe that polemics , we believe that polemics is not convincing . but we believe that storytelling can change the world . and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website receives 35 million hits every month . 
156 nations send our tv channel . 
our magazines are read by millions . 
and we &apos;re doing a number of trips to the ethnosphere where we &apos;re going to place our audience in places of such cultural wonders that they &apos;re going to be blinded by what we &apos;ve seen . and hopefully they will be one by one , the central revelation of anthropology , that this world deserves it , on different ways , to exist , that we have a way of life in a truly multicultural , pluralistic world , 
where the wisdom of wisdom is shared by all human beings for our common well @-@ being . 
thank you . 
i &apos;m going to give you some of the things that i &apos;m going to tell you about my book that cover you with other things that you &apos;ve heard about , and try to make connections . if you don &apos;t notice this , 
i want to start with what i call official dogma . 
the official dogma of what 
the official belief of all western industrial societies . 
the official dogma is : if our goal is to maximize the welfare of our citizens , this is mainly due to maximizing the freedom of the individual . 
the reason for this is that freedom itself is valuable , useful and essential for the development of 
humanity . if people have freedom , each of us is independent about things . to do that , what maximize our common good . and nobody has to decide for us to maximize freedom , and choosing 
the best way to do that is to maximize choice . 
the more choices people have , the more freedom . and the more freedom you have , the more common good . have you 
got it ? i think this is so deeply rooted in us that there is no one in the sense of getting to question it . 
and it &apos;s also deep rooted in our lives . 
i &apos;ll give you some examples of what makes modern progress possible . 
this is my supermarket . no big , just 
short , a little bit of salad dressings . there are 
175 dressings in my supermarket . if you want to use the 10 different native olive oils and 12 balsamic vinegar varieties you could buy to produce a large number of your own salad designs , in the unlikely case that you don &apos;t have one of the 175 in the store . 
so the supermarket works . 
then go to an electronic store to compile a stereo system . speakers , cd player , cassette recorder , radio amplifier and in this one electronics store , there are so many stereo systems . 
we can see 6.5 million different stereo systems , from the components that are offered in this business . 
you have to admit . this is a great selection . 
in other areas , the world of communication . 
there was a time . when i was a boy , you got every telephone service you wanted , as long as he came from ma bell . 
you rented the phone and didn &apos;t buy it as 
a result . and that &apos;s never broken the phone . 
these days are over . 
we now have almost an infinite selection of phones . especially in the world of mobile phones . 
these are the mobile phones of the future . 
my favorite is the middle mp3 player , nose hair trimmer and crème @-@ brû<unk> flambierer . 
and if you still don &apos;t have to do that in your business , you should . be sure you will be 
that soon . it makes people go to business . it makes this question come 
up with , &quot; do you know the answer to this question ? 
the answer is no . 
it &apos;s impossible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much for 
other areas of life . and much more important than shopping , the same goes for exploding choices , 
health care . in the united states , it &apos;s no longer the case that you go to the doctor . and he tells you what to do . 
instead , you go to the doctor . and the doctor says to you , &quot; we could do a . or b make 
a has these advantages and risks . 
b has these advantages and risks . what do you want to do ? 
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot; 
the doctor says , &quot; a has these advantages and risks , and b has those benefits and risks . 
what do you want to do ? 
and they say , &quot; if you were , i &apos;m doctor , what would you do ? &quot; 
and the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . so 
the result is patient autonomy . that sounds like a good thing . but it shifts the burden of responsibility for meeting decisions of the one who has something to know , that is , from the doctor to someone who knows nothing and is most likely ill , and therefore not in the best condition to decide , namely the patient . 
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for prescription @-@ related people . drugs for people like you and me . what if you think , don &apos;t make sense ? because we can &apos;t buy them . 
why do you advertise us ? if we can &apos;t buy because 
they expect us to be the doctor the next morning . and to make a change to the prescription , ask 
something as profound as our identity is . now , a question of choice , how this film should show , 
we don &apos;t inherit identity . we invent them . 
and we invent ourselves as often as we want . 
so every day . when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be . 
in relation to marriage and family , once the standard assumption was : almost everyone had one , and they married so quickly and got children as fast as they could . 
the only real choice was who , not when , and not . what they did after that 
, today , is to have everything easy . 
i teach wonderfully . intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 % less work than before , 
and not because they &apos;re less smart , or because they &apos;re less careful , 
but because they &apos;re busy with other things . you ask yourself , &quot; should i marry or not ? &quot; now or 
later , i &apos;m supposed to have kids or make careers . they are 
all engaging questions . 
and they will answer these questions . even if you don &apos;t do your tasks and don &apos;t have a good grade in my course . 
and you should actually do that . these are important questions to be answered : 
work . we are blessed . as carl has pointed out , technology that allows us to do every minute . every day from every place on the planet to work , except for randolph hotel . 
there is also a corner from which i &apos;m not going to tell you about the wlan . 
i &apos;m not saying anything . because i want to use it 
, this incredible freedom of choice . in terms of work , making decisions again and again and again . whether we should work or not . 
we can help our kids play football , watch with our mobile phone . on the one hand , and on the other , on the other , on the hip , and on our laptop , probably on our lap . 
and even if they &apos;re all off every minute we &apos;re going to see our child mutilating a football game . let us also ask ourselves : should i take this call ? 
the email answers the letter . 
and even if the answer to the question is no , it will change your experience from your child &apos;s football game . very different from what it would have been . 
everywhere we look , big and small things , material things and lifestyle . is a question of choice ? 
and the world in which we lived looked like this . 
so i want to say there were some choices . but not everything was a question of choice . 
and the world in which we &apos;re now living looks like this . 
and the question is , are these good or bad news ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know what &apos;s good about it . so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it . 
all these choices have two effects : two negative effects on humans , 
one effect . paradoxically , he &apos;s paralyzing instead of liberating , 
with so many options from which to choose from . is it very difficult for people to decide at all ? 
i &apos;m going to give you another drastic example . so a study of investment in voluntary retirement provision . 
a colleague of mine had access to vanguard investment files , the giant fund company of about one million employees . and about 2000 different workstations . 
and what she found was , per 10 investment funds offered by the employer , the participation was reduced by 2 percent . 
they offer 50 investment funds , 10 percent fewer employees . take part as if you were offering only 5 . why ? 
because it &apos;s 50 investment funds . the selection is the most difficult to decide . which one should choose that they should postpone it tomorrow . and then tomorrow . 
and then tomorrow and tomorrow . and tomorrow . and tomorrow , of course , never comes . 
understand that this is not just that of eating dog food . if you retire because you don &apos;t have enough money to cover , it also means making decisions . so hard is that they can make a big deal of investment for their employers , 
by not participating , they give up to $ 5,000 a year on from the employer who would have been happy to increase their contribution . 
paralysis is a consequence of too many choices . 
and i think it &apos;s a matter of making the world look like this . you really want to make the decision right ? if it is right for all eternity . they 
don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment fund . or even . the wrong salad dressing . 
so that &apos;s one effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome paralysis and we make a decision , we end up less satisfied with the outcome of the selection . as if we had the opportunity to distinguish between less opportunities , 
and there are several reasons for this . one of them 
is conditioned by the wide selection of different salad dressings . if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect . and what salad dressing is perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that you &apos;re going to have made a different decision that would have been better . and what &apos;s happening is this pictorial . presented alternative leads to you regret the decision . and this repentance has a negative effect on the satisfaction that you have had from your decision . 
even if it was a good decision . 
the more opportunities there are , the easier it is to regret nothing at all . that is disappointing for the choice you make . 
second , what economists call oppertunity costs . dan 
gilbert has a big point this morning , telling us how much the way in which the world is assessing things is depends on what we &apos;re going to compare . 
well . if there are a lot of alternatives to consider , it &apos;s easy to imagine attractive properties , of alternatives that exclude them . this makes them less satisfied . with the alternatives you have chosen . 
here &apos;s an example of the things you don &apos;t think new york is . sorry . but 
here &apos;s what you should have thought . 
here &apos;s a couple on the hamptons . 
very expensive properties , beautiful 
beach , great day . they have it all for themselves . 
what could be better ? 
damn ! the man thinks it &apos;s august . everyone in my manhattan neighborhood is gone . 
i could go park right in front of my house . 
and he spends 2 weeks of thinking , he &apos;s pursuing the possibility he missed . day after day , to have a great parking lot . 
oppertunitätcost reduces the satisfaction we have received through our selection . even if what we &apos;ve chosen is fantastic . 
and the more options there are for choice , the more attractive properties of this selection will be . in the cost of oppertunity , 
this is another example . 
well , this cartoon makes some statements . 
he makes a statement about living in the now , and maybe about doing things slowly . 
but an important point he makes is who you always care for a thing . decide to not do other things . and these other things like many attractive properties . and it &apos;s going to be less attractive to you . 
thirdly , escalation of expectations . 
this has hit me . when i wanted to exchange my jeans , 
i wear jeans . almost all the time . and 
there was a time when it was just jeans of a kind . and they bought them . and they didn &apos;t fit badly . they were incredibly uncomfortable . and if you carry them long enough and often washed enough , you started to get yourself . 
ok . feeling so , to buy new jeans , i went . after many years of wearing the old ones , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a pair of jeans . here &apos;s my size . 
and the seller said , &quot; do you want slender ? &quot; slightly lying or wide , 
you want buttons . or zipper , stone or acid washed . 
do you want jeans ? with holes 
you want to cut down far . kegelig blah blah blah and so on , he told me , &quot; 
my jaw was down . and after i recovered , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to see the way that used to be the only way . 
he had no idea what that was . so i spent an hour trying to get all these damn jeans , and i drank the business . and i say the truth with the best matching jeans i ever had . 
i had better . all of this selection enabled me to have better . 
but i felt worse , 
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to make it clear to me . 
the reason i &apos;m feeling worse was with all these available things . my expectations for what a good pair of jeans are . did they go up ? 
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations when it was only in some way that they were 100 percent species 
when they came . damn . one of them should have been perfect . 
and what i got was good . but it wasn &apos;t perfect . 
and so i compared what i had gotten to what i expected . and what i had was disappointing compared to what i expected . 
adding options to life of people is increasing inevitably . the expectations people have about how well these opportunities will be . 
and this leads to less satisfaction with the results . even if the results are good , no 
one in the world of marketing . 
does this know ? because if you were , you wouldn &apos;t all know what this is all about . 
the truth is more like this . 
the reason is this . all the better than anything worse than anything worse . was it possible for people to experience the experience that is a pleasant surprise ? 
today , in the world where we live . we wealthy industrialized citizens with perfection as expectation . the best thing you can ever hope for is that things are so good as you can expect from them . 
they will never be pleasantly surprised because their expectations are high . 
the secret of happiness that &apos;s what they all came for . the secret to happiness is low expectations . 
i would like to say a short autobiographical moment that i married to a woman . and it &apos;s really very wonderful . 
i wouldn &apos;t have been able to do better . i have not been putting down 
but settling down is not always the case . a bad thing . 
ultimately , a consequence of buying a poorly seated jeans . if it &apos;s just a way to buy , it &apos;s that if you &apos;re dissatisfied and you ask yourself why who &apos;s responsible . the answer is clear : the world is responsible . 
what could you have done ? 
if hundreds of different types of jeans are available and you buy one that &apos;s disappointing . and they ask , &quot; why ? &quot; who is responsible ? is 
it just as ? it is clear that the answer to the question is : they would 
have done better . 
with 100 different types of jeans in the shop window , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes . 
and so when people make decisions , and even when the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed . they accuse themselves . 
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world . in the last generation i 
think a significant , not the only one . but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression . and suicide is also that people have experienced . the disappointing ones are because their standards are so high . and then , if you explain these experiences to yourself , think it would be your fault . 
and so the balance sheet result is that we &apos;re generally better off . lens : and we feel worse . 
so let me remind you . 
this is the official dogma . one , which we all think is right , is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true . 
there is no question of something that is a little choice better than none . but it doesn &apos;t follow the more choice . better than something else . 
there &apos;s a magic amount . i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s . 
i &apos;m pretty sure we can make this point a long time ago when we &apos;ve chosen to improve our common good . 
now , as a principle , i &apos;m almost finished as a principle question . the thing to think about is what all this selection allows . in industrialized societies , material is wealth . 
there are many places in the world . and we &apos;ve heard of many of you who don &apos;t have the problem of too much choice . 
your problem is that you have too little . 
so things i &apos;m talking about are a weird problem of modern rich western societies . 
and what &apos;s so frustrating ? and steve &apos;s annoying . levitt told you yesterday that these expensive and difficult to fix child seats don &apos;t help . 
this is a waste of money . 
i &apos;m telling you that these expensive , complicated decisions . it &apos;s not just that they &apos;re not helping . 
they even hurt . 
they make sure that we are worse off . 
if some of what people in our society can make decisions , were shifted to societies where people are too few choices , things don &apos;t improve , not just people &apos;s lives , but our dignity , too . economists call this a pareto @-@ improvement application . 
income redistribution will ensure that everyone is better off . not only the poor , because all this great selection is plaguing us . 
please read this cartoon and a sophisticated person , &quot; ah , what knows ? &quot; this fish . 
you know , nothing is possible . in this goldfish glass , fantasy 
impoverished a short @-@ sighted view of the world . and that &apos;s the way i first read it . but 
the more i thought about it , the more i came . the view that the fish knows something . 
because the truth is that if you break the goldfish glass , everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . they have paralysis . 
if you break the goldfish glass so that everything is possible , lower your satisfaction . 
they increase paralysis and lower satisfaction . 
everyone needs a goldfish glass . 
this is certainly too limited , perhaps also for the fish . but definitely for us . 
but the lack of a metaphorical goldfish glass is a recipe for misery . and i guess disaster . 
thank you .
