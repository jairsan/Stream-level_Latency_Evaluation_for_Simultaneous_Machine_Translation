last year , I &apos;ve been using these two slides to illustrate that the Arctic ice cap , which is about three million years old , is the size of the lower 48 states , by 40 percent shrunk .
but this does not express enough .
the seriousness of this particular problem , because it is not the thickness of the ice .
in a sense , the Arctic ice cap is the beating heart of our global climate system .
it grows in winter and shrinks in summer .
the next slide I &apos;m showing you is a time lapse , which is what happened in the last 25 years .
the duration is red marked .
how you see it grows on the dark blue marked .
this is the annual ice in winter .
and it shrinks in summer , the so @-@ called &quot; Dauereis &quot; , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which flows out of the body here .
in 25 years , it will be from here to here that it will have disappeared .
this is a problem because warming is the frozen reason to get the Arctic Ocean up . in this , it &apos;s causing large amounts of frozen carbon .
looking which one , when he comes up with microbes to methane , is compared to the total amount of climate @-@ changing substances in the atmosphere , this amount could double .
if we do not exceed this critical point , today , in some shallow lakes in Alaska , methane is already bubbling out of the water by itself .
Professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska is associated with another working group on another one , flat .
lakes Last Winter traveled Video
WOW .
al Gore : you &apos;re doing well .
the question is , how will we be ?
and one reason is this enormous heat storage system is warming Greenland from the north .
this is an annual dew water flow .
but the volumes are much larger than ever before .
this is the Kangerlussuaq River in southwest Greenland .
if you want to know how sea level is rising through land ice melting , here it flows into the sea .
these rivers are growing rapidly , and at the other end of the planet .
the Antarctic , the largest ice mass on the planet , last month , researchers reported that the entire continent is now experiencing a negative ice balance .
and the West Antarctica , which has a few underwater islands , is particularly strong in melting .
this corresponds to 20 feet above sea level .
just as Greenland is in the Himalayas , the third largest ice mass , you see new lakes up there , which were glaciers a few years ago .
40 percent of all people in the world get half of their drinking water .
this melting water in the Andes is a glacier that is the source of drinking water for this city .
the amounts of water have increased .
but if they seal , the same thing is that most drinking water will fall away .
in California , a 40 % reduction in snow cover in Sierra has been seen .
this concerns the storage tanks and the predictions of how they read them , are serious .
this drying up throughout the world leads to a dramatic increase in the amount of fires and the disasters everywhere on the planet have .
in a really extraordinary and never before known extent , increased .
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 .
this is a totally unacceptable pattern of development .
if you do this in the historical context , you can see what it &apos;s doing .
in the last 5 years , we &apos;ve been able to produce 70 million tons of CO2 .
all 24 hours , 25 million tons a day , into the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern Pacific , exactly from the American continent to the west and on both sides of the Indian subcontinent , where there is a drastic decline in oxygen .
in the oceans , the largest single factor for the global economy &apos;s warming is deforestation , which is 20 percent , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s like .
burning of fossil fuels , oil , is a problem .
and coal is the biggest problem , however .
the United States is one of the two largest polluters , along with China .
and the proposal was to create many more coal factories .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
here are the ones that have been in the last few years .
with some green alternatives that have been proposed , there is a political struggle in our country , and the coal industries and oil industries have a quarter of a billion dollars spent last calendar year to clean coal , which in itself is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me of something to celebrate Christmas . I was running around home in my home in Tennessee , where I had a billion tons of carbon mud .
you have probably seen it in the news .
this is in our country , the second largest waste flow in America .
this happened around Christmas , one of the commercials of the coal industry .
at Christmas , this Frosty was the carbarian , is a fun , joyful guy .
he &apos;s in the shell and fullness , in America .
and he helps our economy grow .
frosty the carboniferous will be cleaner every day .
he &apos;s affordable and kind , and workers stay in wages and bread .
al Gore : this is the source of most coal in West Virginia .
the most powerful miner is the head of Massey .
coal Video : don Blankenship
let me just say one thing very clearly .
al Gore Nancy Pelosi Harry Reid
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
al Gore : so the Alliance for Climate Protection has launched two campaigns that are going on .
this is a part of her . video actor .
and at Coalergy , we see climate change as a serious threat to our business .
that is why we have made it the top line .
a significant amount of money to spend on advertising is needed . to clarify the truth , to tell the truth about coal .
the fact is that coal is not dirty .
we believe it &apos;s clean and smells of it , too .
so they &apos;re not worried about the fact that climate change is happening .
leave the quiet to watch us video actor .
Saueber Kohle
you have a lot of heard of it .
so let &apos;s have a tour of this modern , clean coal factory .
fantastic .
this machine is pretty noisy .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
and yet , burning coal .
one of the main reasons for global warming is the remarkably clean coal technology that you have seen here changes .
all of this .
look at it exactly .
this is the clean coal technology today .
al Gore : finally , the positive alternative is mixed with our economic challenge and challenge . the national security challenge .
video narrator : America is in crisis .
the economy , national security , the climate crisis , the red thread that connects all of these is .
our dependence on carbon @-@ based fuels , such as dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now there &apos;s a brave new solution to help us out of this miserable situation .
supply America with 100 percent clean electricity .
within the next 10 years , a plan to return America to work , to make us safer , and to make us help to reduce global warming , is going to be a plan .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
supply America , find more out more .
al Gore : this is the last video .
narrator : it &apos;s about resupplying new America , one of the fastest ways to reduce our dependence on old dirty fuels that are suffocating our world , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about .
man : the future is here : wind , sun and a new energy system .
man No. 2 : new investments to make well @-@ paid jobs
narrator : supply America New
it &apos;s time to accept reality .
al Gore : there &apos;s an old African proverb : &quot; if you want to be fast . &quot;
go alone if you come far , go together
we need to get far , fast .
thank you .
on the last TED conference , I gave an introduction to the LHC .
and I promised to come back to tell them , how to get the machine working .
now it &apos;s time and for the rest of those who were not there at that time .
the LHC is the largest scientific experiment that ever has been tackled . 27 kilometers in diameter .
his task is to improve the conditions . they are less than one billionth of a second after the beginning of the universe .
and that up to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking , ambitious .
this is the machine .
below Geneva :
we take pictures of these mini Big Bang in detectors , and I &apos;m working on this .
he &apos;s called Atlas .
detector 44 meters
in width 22 meters , in diameter
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction so you can see the size .
on September 10 last year , the machine ran for the first time .
and this picture was taken by Atlas .
it caused immense cheering in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first particle of radiation that &apos;s going to make the entire route around the LHC , then deliberately moving into a part of the LHC to get a rain from particles to the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture on September 10 , we knew that the machine was working , which was a great triumph .
I don &apos;t know if this is the greatest cheering , or if it &apos;s someone who created Google &apos;s site .
and the start page , so it found , it means that we have a cultural influence next to the scientific , about a week later .
was there a problem with the machine that was connected to these wires here ?
these golden wires here , these wires , these wires , are 13 thousand amps .
if the machine is running at high performance , the engineers , among them , will look at you and say , &quot; No . &quot;
that &apos;s not what they do .
these are small wires .
you can do that .
because if you think they &apos;re cool down a lot , they &apos;re going to become superconductors at minus 271 degrees .
so colder than space between the two stars , these wires can be able to withstand the tension .
in one of the connections between over nine thousand magnets in the LHC , there was a manual defect .
heat up the wires slightly and then 13 thousand amps met .
suddenly , electrical resistance .
this was the result .
well , all this is even more impressive .
if you imagine that the magnets are moving over 20 tons , and you &apos;re going to weigh about 30 cm .
we damaged about 50 % of the magnets and we had to remove them .
what we did , we conditioned .
they repaired them .
you are all back on your own path .
towards the end of March , the LHC will be operational again .
we will turn it on and expect first data in June or July to collect , to be able to set our journey on to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , in a way , these accidents are rekindling .
the debate on the value of science and engineering at such levels is a matter of fact .
it &apos;s easy to reject this .
I think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to understand the fact that we &apos;re talking about our borders is that we &apos;re going to make the value of things .
how to get the LHC ? I will give my final words to an English scientist . Humphrey Davy , who , as I suspect , was the useless experiment of his apprentice when he defended his apprentice , was Michael Faraday .
the following said , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous .
for the development of the human mind to assume that our scientific ideas are final , that it is not mysteries in the nature that there are our triumphs full of fullness and that there is no new worlds to conquer .
thank you .
I would like to start by asking you to go back to the time you were a child .
thinking back when they played with building blocks while they realized how to get your hands stretched out and grab the blocks and move , they learned to actually think about thinking and solve problems by understanding and changing spatial relationships .
the spatial thinking is close to it , how we can make up a lot of our environment .
as an informatics specialist inspired by the way we interact with real objects .
with my specialist consultant Patti and my colleague Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to wonder .
what if we were to use computers that were used instead of a mouse @-@ pointer that was like a digital finger tip on a flat worksurface ?
what if we were to be able to intervene with both hands and physically take data and take it so that it could be ordered as we want it to be ?
this question was so gripping that we were able to go into the answer .
and siftables developed , in short , a siftable is an interactive computer in size of a biscuit .
you can use your hand to move .
you can look at each other .
you can change your movements .
and they have a screen and a radio receiver .
much more important are physical .
why not use them as blocks of building blocks only by stretching out hands and accessing can move .
and the siftables are an example of a new generation of tools to manipulate digital data .
and if these aids become more physical and a consciousness for their movements develops , mutually , recognize each other .
and the fineness of our dealings with them perceive .
then we can start exploring new technologies and entertaining interaction , and we can start with this .
I &apos;m starting with some simple examples .
this siftable is suitable for video playback .
and if I put it in one direction , the video will move forward .
if I want to put it in the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other .
if I want to put them next to each other , then you &apos;re arousing interest .
if you are surrounded by one @-@ wire , you will notice that , and you can become nervous .
and they feel their movements and their inclination .
an interesting episode of the interactions that we can see was the fact that we &apos;ve seen everyday gestures on data that we could use , like colors , to pour as much as we do with liquids .
in this case , we have three siftables as color pots configured .
and I can use them to paint in the color in the middle . where you can pour in the middle , where they &apos;re mixed .
if we exaggerate it , we can do a little bit of a bit of backsliding .
there are also some nice ways to get to know education , such as languages , mathematics , or logic games , where we can give people the chance to try out quickly .
and the results immediately want to see .
here I am .
that &apos;s a Fibonacci episode that I &apos;ve been able to create with a simple equation program .
that &apos;s a game with words that have a kind of mixture of scrabble and boggle , and that &apos;s a game with words .
basically , you get every round , every siftable randomly assigned letter .
and while you try to make words , these are going to be checked through a dictionary .
then after about 30 seconds , the mixture is mixed again .
and you have a new combination of letters and new ways to try out .
thank you .
these are some children who are on a trip to the Media Lab .
I could make them do it , and I &apos;ve got a video of it .
you have really loved it .
an interesting fact in this type of application is that you can see people not having a lot of instructions .
all you say is that you make words .
and you know exactly what to do .
here are another few people who have been testing it .
that &apos;s our youngest .
beta testers down there right .
it turned out that he was the siftables , stacking only .
so for him , they were just building blocks .
this is an interactive animation .
we wanted to use a language learning tool .
that &apos;s Felix .
he can create new characters into the scene by playing the game Siftable from the table . he &apos;s going to show this figure .
here he leaves the sun rising .
now he &apos;s picking up a tractor in the scene . good work .
yes , by making the siftables shaken .
and they put them side by side , he can let the characters interact .
his own story inventing .
it &apos;s a story with an open end .
and he can decide how to get it .
the last example of what I &apos;m going to have time to show is a music sequencer for live performances that we &apos;ve recently developed .
and in the Siftables as sounds like leadership voice , bass and percussion act .
everyone has four different variations .
you can select which you want to use .
and you can hear these sounds in the sequence that you can put into any pattern , and you can put them in the sequence by going into the sequence of just a sound @-@ siftable , and you can just hold them in a sequence @-@ siftable .
there are effects that you can change live , like the effects of Hall and Filter .
you connect it to a certain tone and tend to make it a bit more adjustable .
and then , more generally , effects like tempo and volume that you can see on the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s look .
we start in which we have the lead in two sequence siftable feed @-@ in .
and these in a row , they sort of sort of sort of add up , and add a little bit more of the voice .
now I add a bass .
now I &apos;m going to do some more stuff about it .
and now I connect the filter to the drums so that I can see the effect live , and I can control it .
I can &apos;t see the whole sequence quicker by accelerating the pace into which one or the other direction is tilting .
and now I connect the filter to the filter with the bass for a little more expression .
I can &apos;t see the sequence as it runs .
this means that I do not have to plan them in advance , but can improvise , prolong or shorten them while doing so .
and finally , I can see the whole sequence by hiding the volume @-@ siftable to the left .
thank you .
how do you see , then , is my enthusiasm for creating new human computer interfaces that are better suited to fit , like our brains and bodies .
and today I had time to give you part of this new design world .
and some of the ways to show what we &apos;re doing in our lab .
the idea I &apos;m going to share with you is that we have a lot of work on the threshold of this new generation of witnesses . we &apos;re going to interact with digital media .
the information in our world brings the information that meets our requirements .
thank you .
I am looking forward to the talks with you all .
I am a writer , writing books is my profession .
but it &apos;s of course more than that .
it is also my great lifelong love and fascination .
and I don &apos;t expect the world to change .
however , recent , something strange in my life and career is happening , which has made me feel like I &apos;ve been referring to this work completely rethinking .
this strange event was that I recently had a book written , and I was very happy to see it .
a biography called Eat Pray Love
this decided differently than all my previous books from any reason . and a lot of things that happened to me , and a big mega event , international bestseller thing , became .
the result is that I don &apos;t care where I &apos;m going to be treated .
as if I were doomed to fall , seriously dedicated to destruction .
for example , they are very concerned about me and say , &quot; Fear not that you &apos;re going to never succeed in surpassing that . &quot;
have you no fear that you can make your whole life continue and never again have a book created ?
someone in the world is never interested in it again .
okay .
this really makes you brave .
it would be worse , however .
if I don &apos;t remember , I would not remember that I was 20 years ago , when I was a teenager for the first time , when I told me that I wanted to be a writer , with the same kind of fear @-@ filled reaction .
people said , &quot; Have you not been afraid ? &quot;
never succeed in this .
have you not been afraid that the humiliation of a rejection will kill you ?
have you not been afraid that you can do this craft all your life and never get anything out of it , and that you can do it on a scrap pile of burst dreams ?
your mouth filled with bitter ashes , the failure .
so , you know , you know .
the answer : the short answer to
all these questions are indeed .
yes .
I &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and he I always had .
and I &apos;ve been thinking a lot more about things that nobody could imagine how algae would be and other terrifying things .
but if it comes to writing , I think recently about it , and I wonder ,
why is that ?
it is logical that the right thing to do is expect someone to be afraid of it . he &apos;s afraid of doing the work he &apos;s called to do .
and what exactly is the creative work ?
companies based in the Netherlands
lot that you &apos;re unsure about us about the state of mind .
in a way that others do , not do .
my father , for example , was a chemist .
and I can remember no situation . in his 40 years of being a chemist , in which he asked , &quot; Whether he &apos;s afraid , chemists , he &apos;s going to be . &quot;
with your chemist blockade John , how are you doing it ?
it just didn &apos;t happen .
you know , you know , to be fair .
the group of chemists have been informed over the centuries not of the reputation of alcoholic , manic @-@ depressive .
people , we get writers , we seem .
but this kind of reputation is that of having it , but not just writers , but the creative of all genres , seems to have that reputation .
mind , monsters , being unstable .
all you do is to get yourself the bitter death figures of really great heads . just out of the 20th century alone .
the young and often by their own hands died .
and even those who don &apos;t actually begin suicide seemed to have been really neglected by their talents .
Norman Mailer said , &quot; Just before his death , in his last interview .
each of my books has made me a little further killed .
an extraordinary statement that you have about your life &apos;s work .
but we &apos;re not even twitching when we &apos;re not even saying something like this because we &apos;re hearing this kind of statement for so long , for that .
somehow we have the view so internalized and collectively accepted that the creativity and suffering somehow somehow naturally belong together .
and that art is always at the end of the day a torment .
the question I have asked everyone here today is this : is this idea for you ? is it perfectly okay ?
feel free to do so , because with just one centimeter distance , you look at it .
I feel like I &apos;m really feeling unhappy with this view .
I think it &apos;s horrible .
and I think they &apos;re dangerous .
and I don &apos;t want to watch them go to the next century .
I think it &apos;s better .
if we want to encourage our great creative people to live , and I definitely know that for me , in my situation , it would be very dangerous .
to begin this dark path of presumption , so to speak , to leak down , especially in the fact that I &apos;m in my career right now .
that means :
see .
I &apos;m pretty young .
I &apos;m just about 40 years old .
I may have more than 40 years of work in me .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything that I &apos;ve got from now on will be written by the world as the work that &apos;s being evaluated after the departure success of my last book came .
right ?
I say it straight away .
because we &apos;re here .
yes .
now , everybody , kind of friends .
it &apos;s most likely that my biggest success is behind me .
Oh Jesus !
what a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts that someone has to get to know at 9 a.m. Gin Gin Gin .
and that &apos;s not what I want .
I would rather continue to do this work that I love .
so the question is how to get to grips with some time of reflection , and I think I &apos;m going to be able to continue writing , a sort of protective psychological construct .
somehow I have to get a picture of a way from now on .
when writing a safe distance to keep between me and my family , very natural anxiety about how the reaction to the problem of being written will be .
while I was in the process of looking for models for this last year to do that , I also had a lot of time to look for in the past .
and I tried to get other societies to find out to see if they might have better or more sensible ideas about it .
when we , like you , can help creatives with the emotional risks that come with creativity , we can do it .
this search led me into ancient Greece .
and the old Rome .
please follow me .
because the circle will rebuild .
but in ancient Greece and Rome , the people don &apos;t believe that creativity is the creativity of people .
okay .
they believed that creativity was a kind of divine servant spirit that came from a distant , unknown source to people , from inexplicable , unknown reasons .
the Greeks called these divine servants @-@ spirits of creativity demons of Socrates is known to be part of it .
he would have been a demon who would have given him wisdom from afar .
the Romans had the same idea , they called it .
this kind of body @-@ less , creative spirit , a genius .
that &apos;s great .
the Romans did not really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
they believed that a genius could not do this kind of magical divine being .
from the belief that it was proverbial in the walls of a studio , it was .
about the same as Dobby , the housekeeper , would come out and help the artist at work , in a way , become invisible .
and the result of the work would be to design .
that &apos;s brilliant .
there &apos;s it .
there &apos;s the distance from which I was talking .
the psychological construct that you have seen from the consequences of your work .
and everyone knew that it worked like this .
right ?
the artist of antiquity was in front of certain things protected , such as too much narcissism , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at everything for you .
book now .
everyone knew you could do this body @-@ less genius that helped you .
if your work didn &apos;t flop completely , your mistake , or everyone knew your genius was a bit lame .
so the people in the West really have a long time talking about creativity .
and then the Renaissance came .
and everything changed .
we had this great idea .
and this big idea was , let &apos;s take the human individual to the center of the universe , to all gods and mysteries .
and there &apos;s no room for you to find mystical creatures .
the commands of the Divine accept .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism .
and people started to believe that the creativity was completely different from their own individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people hear this or that artist .
a genius call it instead of being a genius .
I have to tell you , I think that was a big mistake .
you know , I think a mere person would allow him to think he or she is , like the vessel , like the basin , and the essence , and the source , of all divine creative , unknown , infinite .
mystery is a little bit too much responsibility to get you to a fragile human psyche .
it &apos;s like somebody asking you to see the sun swallowing .
this distorts and distorts entire ego &apos;s .
and it creates all these unattainable expectations of the success .
I think that this pressure to succeed , our artists over the last 500 years , has destroyed .
and if that &apos;s true .
and I think it &apos;s true , is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe to an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the world &apos;s mystery of creative return .
maybe not .
maybe we can use the idea of 500 years of rational humanism not just in an 18 @-@ minute talk .
and there is certainly people in this audience who really are justified scientific doubts about how to register about the idea of basically fairies , people who follow people , and fairy @-@ birds on their projects , etc .
I &apos;m probably not going to see all of you take this trip .
but the question I raise is that the reason .
not .
why not think about it ?
because it &apos;s just as much sense as anything else from the one I &apos;ve heard .
if it was about making the absolutely crazy moody of the creative process , it was a matter of explaining .
a process that , like everyone knows , is ever trying to do something about it .
so in other words , everybody here , not always sensible , is acting .
in fact , he can sometimes feel almost paranormal .
I recently had such an encounter .
when I saw the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone , who is now over 90 , the one who is all her life a poet .
she told me that she was not able to live in Virginia , a village , outside in the fields .
she said she would feel and hear , how a poem was about the landscape on the floor .
she would come to terms with .
she said it was like a thundering train from the air , which was going to cross the country to her .
she felt when it came , because it would make the earth under her feet tremble to the ground .
she knew she was in such a moment , only doing one thing .
and that was in their words , &quot; Race like the devil . &quot;
she ran like the devil to the house while she was running from this poem .
it was only about them being quick enough to make a sheet of paper and a pen . so that they could get it if it was through them thunder , they could catch it and hold it on the sheet .
in other paintings , she was not fast enough .
she ran and ran and ran .
but she reached the house .
and the poem rolled through them ,
and she missed it .
she said it would continue to be moving over land .
and how she said , after another poet , look for it .
and then there was these moments , the part I &apos;ll never forget .
she said that it was moments in which she was almost completely missing .
so she runs to the house and looks for the paper .
and the poem goes through them ,
and she takes a pen .
just when it was going through through them .
and then she said , &quot; It was like it was like you were going to grab her other hand and grab it .
get it back .
the poem on his tail and pulled it back into her back body and took it over to the leaf of paper .
in these occasions , the poem came perfectly and intact on the paper .
but backwards from the last word .
for the first time , when I heard that , I thought , &quot; This is scary .
that &apos;s just like my creative process .
that &apos;s not like my creative work .
I &apos;m not the channel .
I am a mule to work . I have to do every day to work at the same time , and sweat , weep , and really torment me unpleasantly .
but even I in my mule species sometimes have this thing striped .
and I guess that many of you think that &apos;s what they did .
even I had work or ideas that came from a source through me , which I had really not identified , which I could not identify .
what is that ?
and how do we get into relationship with it without having to understand our mind , but rather , on the contrary ?
even in mental health , keep it .
for me , the best thing is :
living example of how to do this .
the musician Tom Waits
I was allowed to see him for a magazine a few years ago .
we talked about this topic .
and you know what ?
most of his life was Tom , who embodies the tormented man @-@ modern artist who tried to ...
these uncontrollable creative impulses , which are living in him , to dominate and cope with them .
but then he grew older and quieter .
he told me that he would one day be on a highway in Los Angeles .
and then the whole thing changed for him .
he went with high speed when he suddenly saw a small fragment .
a melody sounds like it is in inspirations , often for the sake of him tormenting .
hard to grasp .
and he will have them .
it &apos;s magnificent .
he then leaks .
but he can &apos;t hold it .
he has no piece of paper .
he has no pen .
he has no cassette recorder .
it starts with this old anxiety in him , rising like a little like , &quot; I &apos;m going to . &quot;
this thing is losing and I &apos;m going to be persecuted forever by this song .
I &apos;m not good enough .
I &apos;m not going to do it .
but instead of panic , I heard him just stop .
he finished the whole course of thought and did something completely new .
he just looked at the sky and said , &quot; Excuse me , can &apos;t you see I &apos;m driving a car ? &quot; I look like this .
as if I were just writing a song .
if you really want to exist , come to a more favorable moment .
if I look around you , I can &apos;t torture you today , someone else goes and torment Leonard Cohen , his .
whole work process has changed .
not the work itself .
it was often the dark as it was before , and it was still so dark .
but the process and the heavy grief that made it around was lifted .
when he saw the genius out of himself , where he had nothing but trouble , and he was left behind where he was coming from , so to speak .
he realized that there was no inner tormenting thing to be .
it could be a strange , miraculous , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between Tom and the stranger .
external thing that &apos;s not .
Tom was very happy when I was hearing this story , and it also changed a little bit .
the way I worked and it &apos;s got me already before .
this idea saved me .
when I was in the middle of the writing process of Eat Pray Love , I fell into one of these ducts of doubt , into which we all fall .
if we think we &apos;re working on something and it doesn &apos;t work , you &apos;re catching up with thinking that it &apos;s going to be a disaster .
this will be the worst book ever written .
not only bad , but the worst of all times .
I started thinking .
I should like to just stamp the project .
but then I remembered that I was thinking about Tom in the open sky .
and I tried it .
I therefore raised my gaze from the manuscript and spoke my comment in the direction of an empty corner of space .
I spoke loudly , &quot; Hear , you thing , you ? &quot;
and I know both of them .
if this book is not brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my fault .
right ?
because you see that I &apos;m all that I have , I &apos;m investing .
I have not been more than that .
if you don &apos;t know better , you have to cross up here and increase your share of the deal .
okay .
but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what &apos;s the hell about it .
I will continue to write .
because that &apos;s my job .
and I would ask for a record that I am voting for my part today on the job here .
because in the end , it &apos;s like this : centuries ago , in the deserts of North Africa , people turned to moonlight festivals with sacred dances and music .
for hours , the lessons were held until dawn .
these festivals were always great , because the dancers were professional .
and they were fantastic .
but back and forth , very rarely , something special happened .
one of the actors was actually superworldly .
and I know that you know what I mean .
because I know they &apos;re all in their lives , ever before , such a performance has been seen .
it was as if the time was standing still and the dancer was going through a kind of gate .
he did nothing but to do it ever before .
1,000 Nights Before
but everything was together .
and suddenly , he didn &apos;t appear any longer purely human .
he was taken from within and illuminated from below .
and everything was illuminated by a divine fire as if it were something like this .
at that time , people knew what that was .
they called it &quot; by his name . &quot;
they put their hands together and started to sing .
Allah Allah Allah God God God , that is God .
you know , interesting historical footnote when the Ethiopian Southern Spain .
conquered , they brought this custom with them , the debate changed .
over the centuries , from Allah Allah Allah to Olé Olé Olé Olé , which you always have with bullfights and bullfights and Flamenco dances .
if a performer in Spain could find something impossible , something magical .
Allah Olé Olé Allah Great Bravo
incredible .
there &apos;s it .
a fleeting view of God
and that &apos;s great .
because we need that .
but the tricky part follows the next morning .
if the dancer wakes up and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock in a Tuesday , and he &apos;s no longer a little bit of God in himself , he &apos;s not wearing a little bit of it .
he &apos;s just an aging mortal with painful knees .
and maybe he will never again be able to climb to these heights .
and maybe never again will anyone be able to call God &apos;s name .
if he turns , but what should he do with the world &apos;s rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
that &apos;s one of the most painful corrections to a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of pain .
if you are going to be unbelieving from the outset that the most extraordinary aspects of your life would come from you .
if you might just believe that you have a loan from the agency , from an unimaginable source for a fine time of your life that is connected to someone else .
if you &apos;re done with it , if we start thinking about it , change .
all this .
so I started to think .
and so I think I &apos;m sure .
in recent months , while I have been reading the book that &apos;s about to appear as the dangerous , scary , highly anticipated .
successor of my successful race , which I constantly say to myself .
if I &apos;m going crazy about it , I &apos;ve got
don &apos;t be afraid , don &apos;t be discouraged .
just do your
job is still for your contribution ,
what ever he is .
may your job be dancing when you dance .
if the stupid divine genius , the genius that is standing by you ,
decides for a short moment to have a touch of wonder through your effort to show .
then Olé
and if not , dance your dance and olé for you .
despite all this , I believe .
and I &apos;ve got the feeling that we should teach Olé for you .
despite all this , just for you to be able to understand the mere human love and attachment to being there .
thank you .
thank you .
June Cohen Olé
you know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about human genome , and I &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects before .
and what that might mean , and what it might mean to have new groups of genes discovered .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point .
we have biology digitized .
and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code to a new phase of biology , and we &apos;re trying to get it into a new phase of biology .
by creating new life and building new life .
we have always tried to answer important questions .
what is life ?
it &apos;s something that &apos;s happening .
I believe that many biologists have tried to understand and understand the situation in different levels .
we have different approaches to make it possible , except for the minimum components , to simplify it .
we have nearly 20 years of digitization .
when we saw the human genome sequenced , the change from one of the analogue worlds to the biology of the digital world was happening .
the computer now we try to ask if we live , regenerate , or whether we can regenerate new life .
this digital universe .
that &apos;s the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma geitalium , which is the smallest genome in a species that has itself in the lab replicated .
and we tried to see if we could do this with a smaller genome , even smaller genome .
we have managed to do it .
at about one hundred genes to refrain from the 500 or so .
the ones here are :
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to what we trust , you tell me .
that &apos;s simple .
but if we all look at these genes that we have one after another , we eliminate one after the other , it &apos;s very unlikely that this will lead to a living cell .
so we have decided that it will be the only way to move forward .
this chromosome actually synthesize what we &apos;re allowed to do is synthesize the individual components , and so we can sort of sort of ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started to talk to the question , &quot; Can we synthesize a chromosome ? &quot; and it allows chemistry to actually make these really big molecules , which has never been done before .
and if we can do that , we can start the chromosome .
a chromosome is , by the way , just a piece of inert chemical material .
our steps in digitization of life and our steps in digitization were exponential , our ability to write genetic code has been very slow , but it has nevertheless increased .
and our last point would now be to exhibit an exponential curve .
we have 15 years ago started with it .
it actually took a few years , starting with a bioethical review .
before we start the first experiments , how it turned out , DNA synthesization is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that are small pieces of DNA that can make .
30 to 50 letters long
but it &apos;s a degenerative process .
so the longer you get a piece of stuff , the more mistakes happen .
so we had to use a new method to develop this new little piece of stuff , and we had to correct the mistakes .
that was our first attempt , starting with the digital information of the genome Phi .
x 174
it &apos;s a small virus .
the bacteria kill .
we created small pieces , made a bug correction , and we had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we saw this piece of inert chemistry and we went into a bacterium and we got the bacterium started to use genetic code to read and make viral particles .
the viral particles were then removed from the cells and came to the back and killed E. coli .
recently , I started working with the oil industry .
and they said they were going to do this model .
they laughed more than they were here .
so we think that &apos;s a situation .
in the software , actually , your own hardware can build in a biological system .
but we wanted to go a lot further .
we wanted to have a whole bacterial chromosome built .
it has more than 580,000 letters . genetic code .
so we thought .
we &apos;re building it in cassettes .
from the size of the virus , which means the size .
the cassettes could vary to understand . what the individual components of a living cell are ,
design is the key .
and if you &apos;re using digital information in the computer , you have to start this digital information really flawlessly .
when we saw the genome sequenced for the first time in 1995 , the error rate was 10 000 pairs of bases .
we found a 30 error in resequencing .
if we want to use the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
to get off , part of the design is to create pieces .
the 50 letters are long and the ones with other 50 letters overlap pieces to make smaller sub @-@ units so that they fit together .
we have unique elements built in here .
you may have heard that we &apos;re installing watermarks .
think about it .
we have a 4 @-@ letter code A , C , G and T triplets .
this letter , these letters , encode about 20 amino acids .
and here &apos;s a single provision .
for each of these amino acids , we can use the genetic code to translate our words .
sentences &amp; thoughts
at first we only signed .
some people were disappointed that there was no poetry .
we have the pieces constructed in such a way that we can easily break them down with enzymes .
there are enzymes that repair them and restore them .
and we started to play pieces . starting with pieces that were five to seven thousand letters , we added .
these are around 24,000 @-@ spelling pieces to make them rejoin , until they &apos;re up to 72,000 .
in every step , we have these pieces in surplus , so that we can sequence them .
because we tried to create a very robust process , which they did in a minute , and we were going to see .
we tried to get to the point of automation .
so that looks like a basketball playoff .
if we go to these really big pieces , with over 100 000 base pairs .
then these are not simply written in E.coli .
it exceeds all the possibilities of modern molecular biology .
and so we turned to other mechanisms .
we knew of a mechanism that the homologist called recombination , called the biology that biology uses to make DNA repair that could repair those pieces that could fit together .
here &apos;s an example of this .
there is an organism called Deinococcus radiodurans , which has three million wheel of radiation .
you see , in the upper field , that his chromosome just falls apart .
12 to 24 hours later , the whole thing has been assembled together again as it was .
we have thousands of organisms doing this , and we have thousands of organisms .
these organisms can be totally dried up .
you can even be in vacuum .
I am absolutely sure that life in space exists and that life is moving .
on the lookout for aquatic conditions , in fact , the NASA has shown that there is a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a picture of the molecule that we &apos;re producing . by doing this process , we &apos;ve used it .
in fact , we &apos;ve only used yeast mechanisms with the right design .
the pieces we have adapted them : yeast adds them automatically , then .
that &apos;s not an electron microscope .
it &apos;s a regular microscope image .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even do it with the light microscope .
these are recordings of a duration of 6 seconds .
that &apos;s the publication we &apos;re only recently finalising .
these are over 580,000 letters to the genetic code .
it &apos;s the largest molecule with defined structure that ever gets from humans to create .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
if we deal with a font size of 10 and without spacing , we would .
it &apos;s 142 pages include :
just to get this genetic code printed out .
now , how do we start a chromosome ?
how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s a virus that &apos;s very simple .
it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
it is also easier .
if you look at it in eukaryonts , as we are , you just take the nucleus out and give it a different one .
and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;re all talking about cloning .
in archaebacteria , the chromosome is integrated into the cell .
but just recently , we &apos;ve shown that you can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from a cell to another , and you can do it .
and they can activate , we can clean .
the chromosome of a microbial species , roughly speaking , are these two , as far as they are distant from each other as humans and mice .
we gave some extra genes to help us to select this chromosome .
we were crumbling it with enzymes to destroy all proteins .
and it was very amazing when we saw it in a cell ,
and they will be our very mature graphics .
here , the new chromosome was estimated to go into the cell .
in fact , we thought that the end is here .
but we tried to get the process a little further .
that &apos;s the main mechanism .
evolution here .
we find all kinds of species .
here are the second chromosome that we &apos;ve taken , or a third one from somewhere .
every time thousands of characteristics in just one second lead to a species adding people .
so the evolution that evolution imagines as a gene that turns into a gene that &apos;s changed at a time , have missed a lot of biology .
there are enzymes that are called restrictive enzymes that actually digest DNA .
the chromosome that is in the cell has no one , the chromosomes that we inserted , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been doing .
already .
it was built in the cell and realized that the other chromosome was a foreign material .
digested it .
and so we had at the end only one cell with a new chromosome .
it turned blue because of the genes that we inserted .
and after a very short time , it had all the characteristics of the species lost and completely converted into a new species .
based on the new software that we have been able to put into the cell .
all proteins changed , the membranes changed , changed when we saw the genetic code .
was it exactly what we were transferring ?
it may seem like genomic alchemy .
but we can do this by using the move of software DNA , and we can change things quite dramatically .
now I have argued that this is not Genesis , but Genesis .
this is based on 3.5 billion years .
evolution
and I &apos;ve argued that we might be doing this , and we &apos;re going to have a new kind of Cambrian explosion that is going to create massive new species formation based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
I think it &apos;s pretty obvious .
with regard to what we need .
we are in the process of being six and a half to nine billion people .
in the next 40 years to grow to make it in my context ,
I was born in 1946 .
today , three people are on this planet for everyone who &apos;s been living in 1946 , and they &apos;re all living on this planet .
within 40 years , it will take four years .
we have problems with food , fresh and clean water .
medicine : fuel for 6
5 billion people .
it will be a challenge to do this for 9 .
we need more than five billion tons of coal .
30 @-@ plus billion barrels of oil
these are a hundred million .
barrels a day
if we talk about biological processes or any process to get the process replaced , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
then of course , there &apos;s all the CO2 from this material that &apos;s in the atmosphere .
we now have a look at the world of our discoveries , a database of about 20 million genes .
and I want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
the electronics industry had a dozen components .
and see what the diversity of the things is .
the resulting result is that we are first and foremost attacking the borders of biological reality .
and to those of our ideas , we &apos;ve got technologies today .
because of these fast synthesis methods to do what we can do , what we call combinatorial genetics .
we now have the opportunity to have a big robot built that can take millions of chromosomes a day , and we can do it .
if you imagine this 20 million dollar difference in gene production , or if you want to optimize these processes to make octane , or if you &apos;re going to make drugs , new vaccines .
we can work with a small team more molecular biology .
when the last 20 years of science , and it &apos;s just male selection .
we can look for viability , select chemicals , or fuel production , vaccine production , and so on .
that &apos;s a recording of real design software on which we work , with which you can actually sit down and create new species on the computer .
Kenn : you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know what it &apos;s going to look like .
we know exactly how their genetic code looks like .
we focus now on fuel from the fourth generation .
you have recently seen corn grow into ethanol .
what just ?
a bad experiment is , we have fuels .
the second and third generation , which is coming out relatively soon , will have much higher sugar @-@ making activities , like octane , or different kinds of butanol .
but as we think , the only way we can do this is to make biology have a big impact without further increasing food costs or limiting their availability . if you have biology , if you think we see CO2 as the raw material .
and so we &apos;re working on cells that are going that way .
and we think that we &apos;re going to start using the fourth generation of fuels .
and that &apos;s about 18 months of sunlight and CO2 , and that &apos;s a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we &apos;ve all seen different methods .
that &apos;s an organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about one and a half miles deep , at almost boiling water temperatures .
it converts CO2 into methane , under the use of hydrogen , as an energy source .
we investigate whether we can use stored CO2 , which is easy to produce places .
convert the CO2 into fuel to this process .
within a short period of time , we believe .
we could be able to .
one of the fundamental questions of life to solve .
you know , we really have moderate targets like replacing the new system of petrochemical industry .
and that &apos;s exactly when you don &apos;t do that at TED , where else is a major source of energy .
but just as we &apos;re working on it right now .
the same approaches to development of the vaccines are being used .
you have it this year with the flu ,
we are always a year behind . and we have a dollar to little if it &apos;s about the right vaccine , and we have a dollar to little .
I think that this will be changed by changing recombinant vaccines .
that &apos;s how the future might be .
with changes , the evolutionary tree can be accelerated today , with synthetic bacteria , archaea , and possibly eukaryotes .
we are light years away from getting people to improve .
our goal is to only be able to create an opportunity to have a long enough survival to possibly do that .
thank you .
what I &apos;m going to tell you first as quickly as possible is the basic work , a new technology that we need to use Microsoft as part of a takeover just a year ago .
that &apos;s Seadragon .
and it &apos;s an environment where people can either eat locally or away with huge amounts of food and visual data , and they can do it .
we see many , many gigabytes of digital photos here , which you can seamlessly and continuously get up to , swivel in any way you can rearrange .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at , how big these collections are , or how big the images are .
most of them are digital photos of a camera .
but this one is , for example , a scan from the Congress Library .
and it &apos;s in one area of 300 megapixels .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
because the only thing that can be done about the performance of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen .
in every moment .
it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book .
one example of non @-@ image data .
that &apos;s Bleak House of Dickens .
each column is a chapter to move to prove that it &apos;s really a matter of a text , not a text , not an image .
can we do something like that to really get to show that these are a real representation of the text , not an image ?
maybe this is an artificial way of writing an e @-@ book .
I would not recommend it .
this is a more realistic case .
this is an issue of The Guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a section .
and that gives them really the pleasure .
and the good experience .
a real paper edition of a magazine or newspaper to read what &apos;s in itself a kind of medium with several orders of magnitude .
we also have something to do at the corner of this special edition of The Guardian .
we have a false message with very high resolution , which we have drafted much higher than in a normal ad , and it &apos;s a very high resolution .
and we have additional content added .
if you want to use the features of this car , you can see them here , or other models .
or even technical specifications .
and this really does take up these ideas , these restrictions on the space available on the screen , to abolish .
we hope that this will not be pop @-@ ups and other nonsense anymore .
this should not be necessary .
of course , mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and I want to really not do much time here .
besides saying that we also have to go to this area ,
but these are all streets in the U @-@ S , which are all aligned on top of the Earth &apos;s Earth @-@ wide image of NASA .
let us now have something else to pick up .
that &apos;s even live now on the Internet .
you can check it out .
this is a project that &apos;s called Photosynth , which really has two different technologies that connect .
one is Seadragon and the other is Seadragon , and the other is a very good research on computer vision that is done by Noah Snavely , a university student at Washington University , under Steve Seitz &apos;s advice at UW .
and Rick Szeliski from Microsoft , research was carried out a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the Internet .
it is used by Seadragon .
you can see that .
if we take this kind of view , where we &apos;re going to pass through images .
and this experience of the multiple resolution .
but the spatial arrangement of the images is here .
in fact , of importance , the computer vision algorithms have these images together , so that they can give the real space in which these recordings , all near the computer vision algorithms of Grassi Lakes , in Canadian rockies , correspond .
you can see elements of stabilized slides or panoramic image processing here .
and these things were all spatially integrated into each other .
I don &apos;t know exactly if I still have time to give you other environments .
there are those who have much more spatial space .
I would like to make a straight one of the original records of Noah .
and that &apos;s from an early prototype of photosynth at which we &apos;re first in the summer , and we &apos;ve been working to show you what I think I think it really is the point behind this technology , photosynth technology , and that &apos;s what I think .
and this is not necessarily so obvious .
if you look at the environments that we &apos;re looking at on the website ,
we had to look at the lawyers , etc .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral .
Notre Dame , who is only working in computer with pictures of Flickr .
if you just enter Notre Dame in Flickr ,
and they &apos;re going to see pictures of men in T @-@ shirts and on the university grounds , etc .
each of these orange cones represents an image that is seen as one of these models .
so this is all Flickr images .
and they all stand up spatially to this way in relation to each other .
and we can &apos;t wait for this very simple way .
you know , I never believed that I would eventually be working at Microsoft .
I am very grateful for the welcome here .
I guess you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras .
everything is about to be done from the mobile phone camera to professional .
SLRS : a pretty big one .
number of them all in this category of environment have been patched .
and if possible , I &apos;ll get some of the strange things .
many of them are faced with faces , etc . , somewhere .
here are a number of photographs .
here you are .
this is actually a poster of Notre Dame .
that &apos;s been recorded correctly .
we can expect the poster to be a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we &apos;re doing things with the social environment .
there are now data from all collected , from the entire collective memory , how visually visual the Earth looks .
and everything will be connected .
all these photos are connected to each other .
and it &apos;s something that &apos;s going to happen .
the bigger is than the sum of the parts .
you will receive a model that comes from all over the world .
look at this as the continuation of the work of Stephen Lawler on Virtual Earth .
and that &apos;s something that &apos;s going to be done by the complexity that people use it , and it &apos;s growing and its benefits for the user with the application .
ever larger your own photos will be .
with metadata , which indicates another person entering ,
if someone wants to make the effort and to get all these saints labeled and communicated , who they all are ,
then my photo of the Notre is taken suddenly with all the photos of the cathedral .
and I can see it as a starting point to go into this room , dive into this metaverse , take photos of other people , and so I can use some kind of cross @-@ modal social experience with the use of other providers .
and of course by @-@ product , all of this is the immensely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the world that are not only superfluous or satellite images , and so on , but also collective memory .
thank you .
Chris Anderson : I understand you .
right ?
your software allows you to create a specific time within the next few years all the images that someone has in the world shared with you in the future .
in principle , they are linked together .
yes .
it doesn &apos;t do anything else than discover .
if you want , it creates hyperlinks between the images .
and she does this because of the content in the pictures .
and that &apos;s really exciting .
if you want to remember the fullness of semantic information that many of these images have .
how if you want to find a web search for images where you enter sentences and the text of the website contains a lot of information about what image that is ?
but how about it if the picture you were using with all your pictures ?
then the scope of semantic cross @-@ connection and abundance , which is derived from it , is really enormous .
it &apos;s a classic network effect .
ca Blaise
that &apos;s really incredible .
congratulations .
BAA
have you got it ?
thank you .
you know , one of the big neglect when you travel .
and one of the joys of ethnographic research is together with the ethnographic people to live together , who are still interested in the old days . those who remember their past are still in the wind . they are on the rain @-@ smoothing stones .
touch in the bitter leaves .
the plants taste simple .
the knowledge that Jaguar shamans are still beyond the Milky Way , or the importance of myths of the elders of Inuit , still full of meaning , or that in the Himalayas , the Buddhists still have their breath of Dharma .
does the central revelation of anthropology mean that it is necessary to recall ?
that &apos;s the idea that the world is in which we live , not in an absolute sense , but only in an absolute sense , as a model of reality .
as a result of a group of certain possibilities of adaptation , which our ancestors , although successful many generations ago , chose .
and of course , we all share the same adaptive needs .
we will all be born .
we bring children to the world .
we go through initiation rituals .
we must deal with the unstoppable separation by the death of the child .
and so it should not surprise us that we all sing . dance .
and art is what you &apos;re bringing out .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique tone of the song , the rhythm of the dance .
in every culture , it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s a matter of the Penan in the woods of Borneo , or whether it &apos;s a matter of the Penan .
or the voodoo acolytes in Haiti .
or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of northern Kenya .
the Curanderos in the Andes or a caravan factory in the middle of the Sahara .
this is accidentally the colleague who has been with me a month ago , who I went to the desert , or even a Yak shepherd on the slopes of Qomolangma Everest , the godmother of the world .
all these people teach us that it &apos;s still other ways of life , other ways of thinking , other ways of orientating ourselves on Earth .
and that &apos;s an idea that , if you think about it , you can only fill it with hope .
together , the countless cultures of the world form a network of spiritual and cultural life that is the encircled earth .
and for the good of the earth , it &apos;s just as important as the biological network of life that you know as a biosphere .
you can &apos;t imagine this cultural network of life as an ethnosphere .
ethnosphere can be regarded as the total sum of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspirations and intuitions that are of human imagination .
since the beginning of consciousness , the definition of the
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
it is the symbol of all that we are .
and what we call amazing @-@ looking species , we know .
and just like the biosphere is strongly removed , this happened with the ethnosphere , only with the even greater speed .
no biologist would , for example , dare to claim that 50 or more of all kinds are just before extinction , because it &apos;s simply not true .
and yet this is the most apocalyptic scenario in the field of biodiversity , which is hardly in line with what we see as the most optimistic scenario in the field of cultural diversity .
and the decisive indicator is that the extinction of languages .
when each of them in this room was born , the children of the Earth were given 6000 languages .
now , a language is not just the whole of vocabulary or a series of grammar rules .
a language is an expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means of making the soul of a particular culture accessible to the material world , and it &apos;s a means of making it happen .
every language is like an old forest of spirit .
a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and of these 6000 languages , today , while we &apos;re here in Monterey , we &apos;re sitting here , half of them are no longer in the ears of kids .
they &apos;re not going to teach toddlers any more .
that means that if nothing is done , they are actually already dead .
what could be more lonely than the silence enveloping you ?
one of the last of your people to be your language speaking .
no way to have it .
wisdom of ancestors to pass on or hope to children to expect .
and yet this terrible fate is actually happening to someone somewhere on Earth .
ca : every two weeks , because every two weeks , an older person dies and takes the last syllables of an old language with him into the grave .
and I know that some of you say , &quot; Is it not better ? &quot;
so the world would not be a better place .
if we all have one language , we would .
and I say , &quot; Well , let this language be Yoruba . &quot;
let them be Cantonese .
let Kogi be .
and then they would suddenly realize .
as it would be if you were to not speak your own language .
I would therefore like to draw your attention today to a journey through the ethnosphere .
a short journey through the ethnosphere around us to try to understand them . what actually happens to have been lost .
now there are some of us who are , in a sense , forgotten that when I say , I really have different ways of being , different ways of being .
my Take It For example , This Child of Barasana in the northwest of the Amazon , the Anaklona people , believe that they mythologically believe the flow of milk from the east in the belly of holy snakes .
that &apos;s a people who don &apos;t cognitively distinguish between the colors blue and green .
since the tent of heaven is to the forest from which people depend .
you have a strange language .
and a marriage rule that &apos;s called linguistic exogamy .
you have to marry someone who has a different language .
all of this is rooted in the mythological past , the peculiarity of these great houses , where , due to mixed marriages , six or seven languages are spoken , is that you never hear someone who has a language .
you only listen and start to hear , and then talk .
or
one of the most fascinating tribes I &apos;ve ever lived with , the Waorani , in the northeast of Ecuador .
an amazing people who first came to the peaceful contact in 1958 .
in 1957 , five missionaries tried to get in touch and made a serious mistake .
they threw shiny photos of themselves .
what we call a friendly gesture would be , and you forgot that these people were coming from the rainforest in their lives never before going into something two @-@ dimensional .
they raised these photographs from the forest floor , tried to get behind the face or figure , found nothing and found conclusion that this was business cards of the devil and killed the five missionaries with the five spear .
but the Waorani didn &apos;t just kill outsiders with the spear .
they drilled each other . 54 % of deaths happened through drillings .
we followed geneaology eight generations back , and we found two cases of a natural death .
and when we saw people with emphasis doing something about it , they gave us that one of the people , so old , had become so old that he died because of his age .
and we killed him anyway with the spear .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest .
the amazing thing was , their hunters could see the urine of an animal 40 steps away and determine how to smell and determine the animal species that belonged to it in the early 80s . I got a really amazing job when I was .
my professor at Harvard asked if I could be interested in looking for Haiti . and I would like to see secret societies infiltrate those that lay the foundation of duvalier &apos;s strength .
and Tonton Macoutes were .
and the poison that &apos;s been used to kill zombies .
to ensure this sensation makes sense , it was necessary , of course , to tell me something about this remarkable faith of Vodoun .
and Voodoo is not a cult of black .
magic , on the contrary .
it is a very complex metaphysical process of view .
it &apos;s interesting .
if I ask you , the big world religions would list .
what would you say ?
Christianity in the United States
Islam
Buddhism / Judaism
or
what ever ?
a continent is always omitted .
because the presumption was that there was a lack of religious belief in black Africa .
of course , there was one , and Voodoo is simple .
the remnant of this very profound religious thought that was found during the tragic diaspora of the slavery era .
but what Voodoo is so interesting is this living relationship between the two living and the living and the dead .
the living give birth to the spirits .
the spirits can be heard from under the great water . answers to the rhythm of the dance to the soul . to save the soul of the living temporarily .
so that the acolyth is used for a short , shining moment to become God .
Deshab : &quot; the voodooists like to say .
your white ones go to church and say about God .
we dance in the temple and become God .
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to be taken by the Spirit .
how can you harm ?
see these amazing demonstrations , voodoo @-@ acolyths , in a trance state , the glowing coal , without burning .
an amazing illustration of the capacity of the mind to make the body so influence that it can endure it when it enters a state of extreme arousal .
now , of all the people I &apos;ve met , the Kogi were from Sierra Nevada , de Santa Marta , in northern Colombia , the most extraordinary descendants of ancient tyrannical civilization that the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia populated .
and as a result of the conquest , this people moved into an isolated volcanic massive , and they went back .
the above @-@ the Caribbean coast .
in a bloodstained continent , these people were .
the only ones who never heard of the Spaniards until the end of the day , they are being taken by a ritual priesthood , training as a priesthood , but they are very extraordinary .
the young acolyths are born at the age of three and four by their families , separated .
and in a shadowy world of darkness , in stone huts at the foot of glaciers , for 18 years , shut down .
two periods of nine years , deliberately chosen to be the nine months of pregnancy , are the ones that they had in their womb , their mother &apos;s womb .
spend now metamorphically in the lap of the great Mother .
and during all this time , they &apos;re culturally integrated into the values of their society .
values that underline the claim that their prayers and only their prayers are the cosmic or spiritual ones , or we could say that the ecological balance is maintained .
at the end of this amazing initiation , you &apos;ll one day .
suddenly out , taken .
and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 .
see a sunrise .
and in this crystal clear moment of consciousness , the first light , when the sun begins to rise on the slopes of the amazingly beautiful landscape .
suddenly , everything you need in abstract learning is going to happen .
and in astonishing splendour , the priest , resigns and says , &quot; Look , you see , it &apos;s really like I told you .
it &apos;s so wonderful .
you have to protect it .
they call themselves the older brothers and say that we are the ones we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world , we are responsible .
well , this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we think about natives and landscapes , we conjure up either Rousseau and the old town rumour of noble wild animals . what is in its simplification ?
a racist thought is , or on the other hand , Thoreau , saying , &quot; These people are more connected to nature .
when we were natives , we were neither sentimental .
still they are being influenced by nostalgia .
it is not much space for it .
in malaria @-@ contaminated swamps of Asmat or the cold winds of Tibet .
you have , however , still been through time and ritual a mysterious Nimbus of the Earth , which is not formed on the idea of consciously approaching you , but on a far more subtle intuition of the idea that the Earth is in itself only existing . because it is in the human consciousness inhaled into it .
well , what does that mean ?
it means that a little child from the Andes is going to be the one who grows up in the belief that the mountain is an APU spirit that determines his or her destiny , a completely different person .
and another relationship with this resource is , or this place , than a little child , from Montana , who lived in faith , that the world is a mountain , a pile of stones .
the worn @-@ off can be done , whether it is a place of residence for a spirit or a pile of ore , is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that makes the relationship between the individual and nature defined , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about .
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia and I believed that these forests would make it there . I rode to the forest .
that made me a different person ,
when my friends were among the Kwakiutl who believe that these forests are the whereabouts of Hukuk and the curved beak of heaven and the cannibal spirits , the most northern end of the world , spirits who inhabit them at their Hamatsa initiation would .
now , when you start to understand the idea that these cultures are different realities , they can create some of their extraordinary discoveries , you can understand .
for example , this plant here .
it &apos;s a photo I took just last April in the northwest of the Amazon .
this is ayahuasca from which many of you belong . that &apos;s the strongest psychoactive preparation from the repertoire of the shaman .
what ayahuasca is so fascinating is not only the pharmacological potential of this .
this preparation , but its processing .
it &apos;s really made up of two different sources .
on the one hand , there are these wooden lianas that have a number of beta @-@ carbolines ( harmine , harmolin , hallucinogen ) .
this climbing plant alone is about the same as if a tree of blue smoke is spreading on its consciousness .
it is , however , covered with the leaves of a shrub from the family of coffee plants called .
psychotria viridis mixed
this plant contains some very strong tryptamins that are similar to serotonin , dimethyltryptamin @-@ 5 and methoxydimethyltryptamine .
if you have ever seen the Yanomami , how you can see this stuff snuff .
this substance that you can extract from different kinds also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine . this powder to snuff is about as much as it is from a gun run to be shot .
lined with Baroque paintings and landing in the middle of a sea of electricity .
it will not distort reality . it will create dissolution of reality , but rather .
I even talked to my professor Richard .
Evan Shultes
the man who has the psychedelic erea with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in Mexico .
in the 1930s , the Commission launched discussions on this .
I claimed that you could not use this tryptamine as hallucinogen .
since in the moment when you &apos;re going to feel the effects , you &apos;re no longer there to get a hallucination .
but the thing about tryptamins is the fact that they &apos;re not taken orally . because they &apos;re taken by a drug that &apos;s in the human gut .
of course , occurring enzyme named monoamine oxidase will be denaturated .
you can only use the following links with some other chemicals orally : the substances that the Mao denaturate .
well , the fascinating thing is that the beta @-@ carbolins that are contained in the liane , the Mao inhibitors , are exactly the kind of thing that &apos;s necessary to potenate the tryptamins .
ask yourself , then .
how can these people come from a flora of 80,000 species ? astringent plants .
these two morphologically unrelated plants are found in the plants that , if combined in this way , are a kind of biochemical version , so that the whole thing is larger than the sum of its parts .
we use this great euphemism , try and mistake , which is insignificant .
but if you ask the Indians ,
say the plant speaks to us .
so what does this tribe mean ?
the Cofan have 17 variants at Ayahuasca , which they all have at great distance in the forest , which are responsible for our eyes as a kind of appearance .
and then you ask them how they can change their taxonomy .
and they say , &quot; I thought you understand something about plants .
I mean , you know , nothing at all .
and I said , &quot; No .
so it turns out that you can see each of the 17 variants on full moon , and they sing to a single in different pitches , and you can see that .
well , that doesn &apos;t give you a PhD in Harvard .
but it &apos;s much more interesting than to count Stamina .
well , the problem is that the problem is that even those of us who have sympathy for the difficult situation of the natives , they , as orginial and colorful , look at it .
but somehow they were looking at the past , while the real world , our world , is progressing .
so the fact is that you &apos;re going to look at the 20th century in 300 years , not for its wars or technical innovations , but rather for its wars or technical innovations , but rather for an era in which we were present , and the massive destruction of biodiversity and cultural diversity on Earth .
either actively supported or passively accepted .
so the problem is not the change .
all cultures have always been interested in the dance with new ideas for life .
and the problem is not technology , technology itself .
the Sioux Indians heard no less Sioux . Sioux was the first to hear them bow and arrow tasks than the Americans .
Americans stopped being Americans when they were horse and horse @-@ drawn cars , tasks that threaten change and technology .
the integrity of the ethnosphere
it &apos;s power .
the ugly face of the rule
and where ever you can get into the world ,
you will discover that these cultures are not going to be doomed .
these are dynamically living peoples whose existence is characterized by recognizable forces . these peoples are driven by their capacity to adapt .
whether it is a question of the tremendous deforestation in the home country of Penan , a nomadic people from Southeast Asia , Sarawak , a people who had been free to live in the forest a generation ago , and now become slavery and prostitution .
on the riverbank , the river was humiliated from where you can see that even the river with the mud is polluted , which is almost half Borneo , into the South China Sea .
it seems to float from where Japanese freighters are floating on the horizon .
ready to take their ships with raw tree trunks , which are used to fill them out of the forest .
or , as in the case of the Yanomami , where it &apos;s disease carriers that are dragged in during the gold rush .
or if we go up into the mountains of Tibet , where I &apos;m looking for a lot of stuff .
if you do not see the ugly face of political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the physical extinction of people , is generally condemned .
but ethnocide , destruction of the way of life .
people will not only not be condemned , but will be condemned in general and in many places as part of a development strategy .
and you can &apos;t see Tibet &apos;s suffering .
if you don &apos;t want to do it at the lowest level , I went to a young colleague , 6000 miles from Chengdu in western China , across the country , through southeast Tibet , to Lhasa .
and only when I went to Lhasa did I see the face behind the statistics of the statistics that you hear , 6000 holy monuments that were built in rubble and ashes , and they were all turned into dust .
1.2 million people who have been killed during the Cultural Revolution by the cadres .
the Father of this young man was called a follower of the Panchen Lama .
that meant that he was killed during the Chinese invasion immediately .
his uncle fled with her holiness in the Diaspora .
people after Nepal brought
his mother was imprisoned as punishment for the persecution of the crime , to be wealthy .
he was born at the age of two in prison , smuggled to get under her feet of rock .
because they were not living without him .
the sister who had done this brave act was taken to an educational camp .
one day she stepped out of the box accidentally on a Maos bracelet .
and for this violation , she had to be in a hospital for seven years .
suffering of Tibet can be unbearable .
but the redeeming spirit of men is something unforgettable .
and in the end , we &apos;re really facing an election .
do we want to be in a monochromatic world of monotony or polychromatic world of diversity ?
Margaret Mead : the great anthropologist said before she died that it was her greatest fear , and she was a great anthropologist .
that while we are heading towards a thread of uncreative generic world view , we are not only moving the entire spectrum of human imagination to a narrowed way of thinking , we would see that we are one day going out of a dream , waking up and forgetting that it has ever been possible for others .
and it &apos;s humiliating to think about the fact that our genus , maybe since 600,000 years , exists .
the Neolithic Revolution , which has brought agriculture to us and has brought us to worship at this moment in the seed grain .
poetry of the shaman through prose , prose of the priesthood replaced and hierarchy , specialization and surplus created , found before only 10,000 years ago , took place .
modern industrial world , as we see it , is barely 300 years old .
well , this superficial story doesn &apos;t tell me that we &apos;re all responding to the challenges that we &apos;re facing in the next millennia , and we &apos;re going to have to face .
if we look at these countless world cultures according to the meaning of humanity , they answer 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we will have the opportunity to rediscover that we &apos;re what we &apos;re , people with full consciousness who are aware of the importance of giving everyone the opportunity to see a space that thrives in all people and gardens .
the guarantee must be :
and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photo that I took on the northern end of the Baffin Islands .
when I was on the Narwhal hunt with Inuits , and this man told me Olaya , &quot; A wonderful story of his grandfather .
the Canadian government is not always very good at dealing with the Inuit .
and while the 1950s were in the course of establishing our rule , they were forced to move to settlements .
the grandfather of this old man refused to give up the family .
fear of being alive had taken up the fear of all weapons and tools from him .
now you have to know that the Inuit is not afraid of the cold .
they used them to their advantage .
the sliding rails of their sled were originally made of fish , wrapped in caricature skin .
the grandfather of the man was not afraid of the Arctic night or the blowing storm .
he slipped out , let his pants out of seal fur down , and threw them in his hand .
and when the faeces freeze , they formed a little bit of it into the shape of a knife .
he sprayed saliva on the sides of the sewage knife .
and when it was completely frozen , he struck a dog with it , so that he skinned the dog , and improvised a tableware .
the skeleton of the dog and improvised a sledge , spun another dog on , and vanished over the ice floes with the fecal knife on the belt .
so you can &apos;t get anything done .
and this is on many ways a symbol of the resistance of the Inuit and all the natives on the world , and it &apos;s a symbol of the resistance of the Inuit .
the Canadian government gave the Inuit a new mandate in April 1999 to fully control an area .
the bigger is California and Texas , together .
it &apos;s our new home country .
and it &apos;s called Nunavut . it &apos;s an independent area .
they control all mineral deposits .
an amazing example of how a nation , a state , can make reparation with its inhabitants and reach them .
and ultimately , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious .
at least for those of us who are too distant from these distant goals of the Earth to realize that they are not far from being at all .
you are the home countries of someone .
they represent parts of human imagination that are in past times , and that are for all of us , dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , are part of the geography of hope .
what we do at National Geographic ultimately try is that we believe that politicians never have anything to achieve .
we believe that polemics , we believe that polemics are not convincing .
but we believe that storytelling is the way to change the world .
and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution in history .
our website receives 35 million hits every month .
156 nations send our TV channel .
our magazines are being read by millions .
and we &apos;re doing a number of trips to the ethnosphere , where we &apos;re going to see our audience in places of such cultural wonders that they &apos;re going to be blinded by what we see .
and hopefully they will be one after the other , the central revelation of anthropology , that these world is worthy of it , to be able to exist in different ways , to have a way of life in a truly multicultural , pluralistic world where the wisdom of all human beings can be found in our common well @-@ being .
thank you .
I &apos;m going to give you some things out of my book that deal with other things that you &apos;ve heard of , and try to make connections .
if you don &apos;t notice this , I want to start with what I &apos;m doing as an official dogma .
the official dogma of what the official belief of all Western countries is .
the official dogma is : if our goal is to maximize the welfare of our citizens , we will do so above all through maximizing the maximum freedom of individuals .
the reason for this is that freedom is at and for itself valuable , meaningful and essential for the human being .
if people have freedom , everyone acts as a self @-@ employed person to do things . they do things that maximize our common good .
and nobody has to decide for us , the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choices .
the more choices people have , the more freedom .
and the more freedom you have , the more common good .
have you got it ?
this is , I think , so deep rooted in us that there is no one in the sense of getting it questioned .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
I &apos;ll give you some examples of what modern progress allows us to do .
this is my supermarket .
no big , just short , a little bit of salad dressings .
there are 175 dressings in my supermarket .
if you want to use the 10 different native olive oils and 12 balsamic vinegar varieties you could buy to make a large number of your own salad designs , in which unlikely that you don &apos;t have one of the 175 in the store .
so this is how the supermarket works .
then go to a electronics store to buy a stereo system .
speakers , CD Player , Cassette Recorder , Radio Amplifier
and in this one electronics store , there are so many stereo systems .
we can &apos;t get 6.5 million different stereo systems , from the components that are used in this business .
you have to admit .
that &apos;s a great selection .
in other areas , the world of communication .
there was a time .
when I was a boy , there , you got every telephone service you wanted , as long as he came from Ma Bell .
you rented the phone and bought it not as a result of that .
of this , the phone was never broken .
these days are over .
we have now almost an infinite selection of phones .
especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is the one in the middle MP3 player , nasal hair trimmer and crème @-@ brû<unk> flambierer .
and should you do that so far , not in your business , have you seen it ?
be sure that you can do this soon .
it brings people to the shops , and it &apos;s going to ask this question , &quot; Do you know the answer to this question ?
the answer is no .
it is impossible to use a mobile phone that is not too much for others to do .
the much more important than shopping are the same , the explosion of choices , health care .
in the United States , it &apos;s no longer the case that you &apos;re going to go to the doctor .
and he tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor .
and the doctor tells you , &quot; We could do a .
or B make a , has these advantages and risks . B has these advantages and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; Doctor , what should I do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; A has these advantages and risks , and B has those advantages and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; If you were me , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
and the doctor says , &quot; But I &apos;m not you .
the result is patient autonomy .
that sounds like a good thing .
but it shifts the load of responsibility for the meeting of the decisions of someone who is doing something , that is , from the doctor to someone who knows nothing and most likely is ill , and therefore not in the best condition to decide , namely , the patient .
there is an enormous marketing for prescription @-@ related people .
medicines for people like you and me .
what if you think , don &apos;t make sense ?
because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do you advertise us ?
if we don &apos;t buy because they expect that we can &apos;t get the doctor the next morning .
and to make a change to the prescription , ask something as profound as our identity is .
now a question of choice : how to show this slide ? we don &apos;t inherit identity .
we invent them .
and we invent ourselves so often anew as we want .
so , every day .
if you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , once the standard assumption was :
almost everyone had one , and one married so quickly , and got so fast children as one could .
the only true choice was who didn &apos;t , when and not .
what you did after that , today , everything is easy to have .
I teach wonderfully .
intelligent students and I &apos;ll give you 20 % less work than before , and not because they &apos;re less smart , or because they &apos;re less careful . they &apos;re less careful , but because they &apos;re busy with other things .
you ask yourself , &quot; Should I marry or not ? &quot;
now or later , I &apos;m supposed to have children or have a career .
they &apos;re all engaging questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions .
even if you have not done your tasks and you don &apos;t have a good grade in my course .
and you should do this in fact .
these are important questions to be answered : work .
we are blessed .
like Carl , it has been clear that technology that allows us to do every minute .
every day , from every place on the planet to work , except for Randolph Hotel ,
there are also a corner from the one I don &apos;t tell anybody about , where the WLAN works .
I don &apos;t say anything .
and I want to use this incredible freedom of choice .
in terms of work , making decisions , making decisions again and again and again .
whether we should work or not .
we can help our children play football , watch with our mobile phone .
and on the one hand , and on the other , on the other , on the hip , and on our laptop , probably on our lap .
and even if they all are switched off every minute in the world we give our child a chance to mutilate a football game .
let us also ask ourselves : should I take this call ?
the email answers the letter .
and even if the answer to the question &quot; No &quot; is , it will change your experience from your child &apos;s football game .
very different from what it would have been .
everywhere we look , big and small things , material things , and lifestyle .
is a question of choice ?
and the world in which we lived saw so much .
this is what I want to say : there were a few choices .
but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world in which we &apos;re now living sees it look like this .
and the question is , are the good or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about it .
so I &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
all these choices have two effects : two negative effects on people , one effect .
paradoxically , it &apos;s paralyzing , instead of liberating , with such many options from the world that you can choose from .
if people fall very hard to get involved in deciding at all .
I &apos;m going to give you another drastic example .
for this purpose , a study on investment in voluntary retirement provision .
a colleague of mine had access to investment files from Vanguard , the giant fund company of about one million employees .
and about 2000 different workstations .
and what she found was , per 10 investment funds that the employer offered , the participation was increased by 2 percent .
they offer 50 investment funds , 10 percent fewer employees .
take part as if you were just offering 5 .
why ?
because it has 50 investment funds .
the selection is available , so it &apos;s hard to decide .
what to choose from , that you want it to be postponed tomorrow ?
and then tomorrow .
and then tomorrow and tomorrow .
and tomorrow .
and tomorrow , of course , never comes .
understand that the problem is not just that of human dog food , food .
if you are retired , because you &apos;re not enough money , you &apos;re not going to have to go back .
it also means making decisions .
so hard is that they have great investment opportunities for their employers , which are not giving participation , they give up to $ 5,000 a year to get from the employer who has been happy to make their contribution to increase .
paralysis is a consequence of too many choices .
and I think it &apos;s a matter of making the world look like this .
you want to make the decision really right ?
if it is for all eternity right
you don &apos;t want to get the wrong investment fund .
or even .
the wrong salad dressing .
so that &apos;s one effect .
the other effect is that even if we &apos;re paralyzing , even if we &apos;re making a decision , we end up less satisfied with the outcome of the selection .
as if we were able to do so between less opportunities , we would have had the opportunity to choose between less opportunities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is conditioned by the great selection of different salad dressings .
if you buy one and it &apos;s not perfect .
and what salad dressing is perfect ?
it &apos;s easy to imagine that you &apos;re going to have a different decision that could have been better .
and what happened is this pictorial .
presented alternative leads to you having to make the decision regretted .
and this repentance has a negative effect on the satisfaction that you have made of your decision .
even if there is a good decision .
the more opportunities there are , the easier it is to do nothing at all to regret .
that &apos;s disappointing for the election that you make .
secondly , what economists call oppertunity costs .
Dan Gilbert has a big point today , this morning , by telling how much the world is going to do in which we evaluate things depends on what we &apos;re going to compare it .
well .
if it &apos;s very many alternatives to thinking about , it &apos;s easy to get attractive features , of alternatives that you exclude .
this makes them less satisfied .
with the alternatives that you have chosen .
here &apos;s an example of the kind of things you don &apos;t know that are New York .
sorry , I &apos;m sorry .
but here &apos;s what you think you should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple of the Hamptons .
very expensive real estate , beautiful beach , great day .
you have it all for yourself .
what could be better ?
damn !
the man thinks it &apos;s August .
everyone in my Manhattan neighborhood is gone .
I could go straight in front of my house .
and he spends 2 weeks from the thought pursued the one he had the opportunity to miss .
day after day , a great parking lot to have . Oppertunitätcost reduces the satisfaction we get through our selection .
even if what we choose is not fantastic ,
and the more opportunities it can choose from , the more attractive properties of this selection will be .
in the cost of oppertunity , this takes into account another example .
well , this cartoon makes some statements .
he makes a statement about it in the now living , and perhaps about it , things slowly doing .
but an important point he makes is that he &apos;s always who you &apos;re looking for a thing .
decide to choose other things not to do .
and these other things like many attractive properties .
and it &apos;s going to be what you &apos;re going to do , less attractive .
thirdly , the escalation of expectations .
this has hit me .
when I saw my jeans exchange , I was wearing jeans .
almost all the time .
and there was a time when there was only jeans , one kind of jeans .
and they &apos;ve bought them .
and they have done a bad job .
they were incredibly uncomfortable .
and if you &apos;ve been carrying them long enough and often washed enough , you &apos;ve started to get involved .
OK .
feeling
so I went to buy new jeans .
after many years of carrying the old
and I said , &quot; I &apos;d like to have a pair of jeans .
here &apos;s my size .
and the seller said , &quot; Do you want slender ? &quot;
easy to install or wide , you want buttons .
or zipper , stone or acid washed .
do you want jeans ?
with holes you want to cut down far .
Kegelig Blah Blah Blah
and so on , he told me , &quot; My jaw was down .
and after I recovered , I said , &quot; I &apos;d like to see the way that used to be the only way .
he had no idea what that was .
so I spent an hour trying to get all these damn jeans and dungeon the business .
and I say the truth with the best fitting jeans , the one I &apos;ve ever had .
I had better .
all this selection enabled me to make it better to have it .
but I felt worse , why ?
I wrote a whole book to tell you to try to get it explained to me .
the reason why I was getting worse was that I was having all these available opportunities .
my expectations for what kind of good couple of jeans are .
went up .
I had very low expectations .
I had no concrete expectations when it came to just one thing : there was a sort of thing that they came up with in 100 species , damn .
one of them would have been perfect .
and what I got was good .
but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so I compared what I got . to what I got , to what I expected .
and what I had was disappointing in comparison to the things that I expected .
adding a range of possibilities to life of people increases inevitably the number of people .
expectations that people have about how to do well these opportunities are going to be .
and this leads to less satisfaction with the results .
even if the results are good , no one in the world of marketing .
white - this .
because if you were to , you would not all know what it &apos;s all about .
the truth is more like this here .
the reason is that earlier .
all the better than anything worse was than everything worse was worse .
was it for people possible to experience the world of the world that is a pleasant surprise ?
nowadays , in the world where we live .
we wealthy industrialised citizens with perfection as expectation .
the best for you ever hope for is to have things done like that . are you as good as you can expect from them ?
they will never be pleasantly surprised because their expectations , my expectations , are high .
the secret to happiness
that &apos;s what you all came for .
the secret to happiness is low expectations .
I would like to say a short autobiographical moment that I &apos;ve been married to a woman .
and it &apos;s really wonderful .
I would not have done better if I had done it .
I have not been putting down
but settling down is not always the case .
a bad thing .
ultimately , a consequence of buying a poorly seated jeans .
if it &apos;s just a way to buy , it &apos;s that if you &apos;re dissatisfied and you &apos;re wondering why you &apos;re responsible for who .
the answer is clear : the world is responsible .
what would you have done ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available and you &apos;re buying a one that disappointing is .
and they ask , &quot; Why ? &quot;
who is responsible ?
is it just as ?
it is clear that the answer to the question is :
they would have done better .
with 100 different types of jeans in the shop window , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so when people make decisions and make decisions , and even when the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed .
they accuse themselves .
clinical depression exploded in industrial world .
in the last generation
I think a significant , not the only one .
but a significant contributor to this explosion of depression .
and suicide is also that people experience that .
the disappointing ones are because their standards are so high .
and then , if you look at these experiences , you have to think it would be your fault .
and so that &apos;s the balance sheet that we generally do better .
lens : and we feel worse .
so let me just remind you .
this is the official dogma .
one , the one that we all think is right , is completely wrong .
it &apos;s not true .
there is no question of choosing something better .
but it doesn &apos;t follow the more choice .
better than something else .
there is a magical amount .
I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
I am pretty sure that we can do this for a long time , when we have chosen our common good to improve .
now , as a principle , I &apos;m almost finished as a principle question .
the thing about thinking about is that what all these choices are able to do .
in industrialized societies , the material is rich .
there are many places in the world .
and we &apos;ve heard of many of you who have not had the problem that has led to too much choice .
your problem is that you have too little .
so things about the things I &apos;m talking about are a weird problem of the modern rich Western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating ?
and it &apos;s annoying Steve .
Levitt gave them a story yesterday that these expensive and hard to fix child seats don &apos;t help .
that &apos;s a waste of money .
I &apos;m telling you that these expensive , complicated decisions .
it &apos;s not just that they &apos;re not helping .
they even hurt .
they ensure that we get worse because we &apos;re worse .
if some of what people in our society want to make choices in societies were postponed , in societies where people were not sufficiently selective , things didn &apos;t just improve life , people &apos;s lives , but our dignity also improved .
economists call this a &quot; pareto @-@ improvement application . &quot;
income redistribution will ensure that all of us are better off .
not only the poor , because all these great choices plague us , but also the poor .
read more about this cartoon and a sophisticated person , &quot; Ah , what knows ? &quot;
this fish .
you know nothing is possible .
in this goldfish glass , fantasy impoverished a short @-@ sighted view of the world .
and that &apos;s the way I &apos;m doing it first , I &apos;ve read it .
the more I think about it , the more I came to it .
the view that the fish knows something .
because the truth is that if you know the goldfish glass breaking , everything can be done , you don &apos;t have freedom .
you have paralysis .
if you like to break the goldfish glass so that everything is possible , lower your satisfaction .
they increase paralysis and lower the risk of satisfaction .
everyone needs a goldfish glass .
this is certainly too limited , perhaps also for the fish .
but definitely for us .
but the lack of a metaphorical goldfish glass is a recipe for misery .
and I guess disaster . thank you .
